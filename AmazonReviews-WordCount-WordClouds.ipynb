Thank you R.BNGR This is an awesome mic! Used to cool equipment inside credenzas.  Worked great. Note- Does not Fit Epiphone SG Special! Mine is circa 2002 model and it will not fill the space between the humbuckers completely. Everything else is Great and good craftmanship otherwise. I had to add my own custom made filler plate to complete the build. I have not been able to find this style pick guard that will fit my guitar with proper spacing between humbuckers without a &#34;custom&#34; price and having to send your guitar out.<br />Good price, but be prepared to do some custom work yourself! Well built Ukulele! My daughter loves it! Had to replace a new light after a lightning storm. Works fine.  Hope it lasts through the warranty period this time! I\\'ve owned multiple fixed boards over the years, but I much rather stick with individual effect units*** I\\'ve purchased a few empty boards and they wound up falling apart, then it\\'s deep six time *** My brother-in-law purchased the GPTBLPWR as a X-Mass gift 5 years ago, and much to my surprise, it\\'s still kicking ass*** I\\'ve dropped it a few times, it\\'s been accidentally stepped on a few times, kicked around numerous times, but after all this abuse, she\\'s still rockin\\' as hard as ever *** Yes, it\\'s heavy, Yes, the power cord is a bit flimsy, but I think I can deal with those negatives*** Actually, I upgraded the power cord to a heavier gauge which only cost me an extra 5 bucks and a little of my time *** I\\'d totally recommend this product  to anyone who is constantly on the move with there gear *** The cool thing about this is that when my bro-in-law purchased it 5 years ago, it was only $89.95 *** To bad guy\\'s, you should have taken a chance back then, you could have saved  a little change, but all in all, it\\'s very worth every penny*** You won\\'t be disappointed, I can guarantee it *** Thanks again Amazon / Gator for another job well done *** Consistent quality, no strong odours, works well. My son\\'s favourite trumpet valve oil. He is a serious player and this is also what his teacher (a professionalt rumpeter) uses. It\\'s by far the best pop filter i have used, extremely effective, i did not loose any air at all, my only problem is that the goose-neck and mounting clamp are cheap and hard to adjust Beautiful set. Only the sound not at long and deap. Bridge pickup was broken. I replace d the pickup and ok now. To cheap to send back. Feels good and last long I love the stand.  I bought two.  The only glitch is that when I attached a cable to my guitar, the cable\\'s plug hit the floor when the guitar was in the stand.  A right angle plug solved the problem. On time. Looks great. You have to anticipate tapping new screwholes when you replace a pickguard! I was hoping it would work well, but tried a second cord and would only receive a lot of static in both tries.  Was never able to get clear sound at all and tried moving away from any possible interference etc.  Manual lacked any kind of trouble shooting and online was lacking as well. Good sound for its size and price.  Great of a young guitar student the learn on w/o breaking the bank. Wow! I didn\\'t expect the quality and intonation of this product to be so high. It really is a musical instrument and the book is a fantastic way to begin. Thanks for the thoughtfulness that went into this product! Great product, fast shipper I needed to dim the light from my bedroom cable box.  This worked great. It went on easy and does exactly what I needed.  I used two tinted ones (one over the other) and it is dim enough where its no longer disturbing sleep but still works with the remote. Fit my cheep over seas pickup but will not fit USA made Fits great just as it should. Seemed protective enough. It could only be better if it had a shoulder strap. Exactly what I needed, perfect for throwing it on the back, hopping on the bike and playing wherever. For the price- wait.  Hold on. This is Audio Technica. This was amazing for it\\'s price! I saw the name and thought \\\\\\\\\"Why the low value?\\\\\\\\\" It\\'s a seasoned veteran that knows it\\'s s***. Don\\'t like how sensitive it is when you use it? Remember, a condenser is meant to be clear and crisp. Noise removal is your friend for pre-recordings. Live streams are a little different but none of my viewers complained. :D THEY LOVE IT! Nice soprano for the $$ Great little set for the money! I am always looking for unique items that will WOW my grandchildren when they come to visit. This Magic Ball light is fun; it fills a room or tent with light and the automatic sound activation has my Grandchildren singing their hearts out, then giggling and laughing. Priceless!<br /><br />This has been thoroughly tested and approved by all of my grandchildren over the last couple of months and never seems to lose its appeal. It would make a nice inexpensive gift for any child for their room.<br /><br />1. RoHS, CE certified<br /><br />2. This is made of heavy plastic and has a 5 inch diameter and is 5 1/8th inches tall, it has a clear dome and colored LED lights shoot from the dome in addition to a ring of LED lights around the bottom which in combination create a two dimensional light show.<br /><br />3. The bottom is made with 2 indented screw holes and an indentation for the cord so it is easy to hang on the wall or ceiling, or just plug it in and set it on a stand.<br /><br />4. There are a total of 51 LED lights in Red, Green and Blue that rotate and fill the room with lights, for its price and size this is a very nice little light with a big light show that my Grandchildren love.<br /><br />5. There is also automated sound activation that changes the light show to match the music or at my house the songs my grandchildren sing to get the lights to speed up and change. This sound activation is not as sensitive as some lights I have tried and doesnâ€™t pick up every nuance however it is a wonderful feature and I love hearing my three year old singing. The giggling and laughing Priceless.<br /><br />6. There are two things that I would change on this, the cord is only 35 inches long and there is no on/off switch or sound activation switch. I have it plugged into a surge protector with a switch on it so it is not constantly being plugged in and unplugged.<br /><br />Received a free sample for evaluation and unbiased review. Works fine. I gave this five stars, but actually wasn\\'t able to use it with my equipment.  I had read online at the manufacturer\\'s website this would work, but due to plug size it did not.  I do not think it is fair to give a low rating due to the fact that the information received other than on Amazon was incorrect.  it wasn\\'t a big deal. Very easy to use Great addition for our worship team, tons of fun! Works as advertised. Perfect for my Line 6 Relay 50. GREAT QUALITY Gift. I don\\'t know It works well while it can. Mine failed when I tried to use it the third time - two of the three prongs in the back that hold the tuner head broke, so I tried to tie it up with a wire but the battery is completely out. The plastic is so brittle and the battery went out of charge so quickly. Not worth the $9.95 price at Amazon. I needed a tuner that was easy to use and accurate. This one is both! A bit tiny, but great build quality. It\\'s really helpful to my daugther during her violin practices! She just love it!!! Really bad. Bought as a midi trigger kit but the latency from the module is ridiculous. Comlete waste of $$. A toy. Nice nice Microphone. good delivery It does what it\\'s supposed to do but it\\'s cheaply made. I broke it the 1st week I had it but managed to fix it. Can\\'t complain too much for $10 love them great little box with a lot of punch! Works great, gave it 4 stars because there were no instructions.<br />Open the clip, slide your led strip UNDER the contacts, making sure the contacts are<br />on the copper surface of your strip lights, close clip and make sure it locks. Husband loves it! It does it\\'s job as I want it. Not sure how I got along without it.  It makes tuning the Banjo and Uke so much simpler.  What a great little device. Very well made, folds down and is great to travel with. I would highly recommend it. Killer tone, Light weight, and plays like butter. I would like to change the wiring for the neck pickup but it sounds so good like it is I\\'m afraid to change anything. Other than intonation I haven\\'t moved a screw on this guitar and it\\'s perfect with a set of 10\\'s on it. This is a very good drum set. Our whole family has fun playing with it and I\\'m glad that we can practice without annoying everyone else. Ok There was only one clip in the box even though this is supposed to be a two pack.  The one we did receive works fine.  Nothing glamorous, but effective. I am never buying Beats by Dr. Dre again. These headphones put my Solos to shame! I had Mixrs as well, and these just destroy the competition. I am only buying from Audio-Technica from this day forward.<br />Great sound, great value, better ingredients Papa Jo-er I mean it\\'s a great pair of headphones. I love these lights they are very bright vibrant colors. The remote hasn\\'t worked on them but they change colors and they flash.  Didn\\'t come with 12v adapter either My son is a drummer in a band and I bought this for him as a surprise. He loves it! Says it fits all his drum gear and room to spare. He thanks me all the time for this purchase. Chalk one up for mom!! Works great I\\'m very happy with the product thanks... This is a fantastic piano keyboard for a very fair price. It\\'s got incredible sound quality, the effects are all high quality and really fun to mess around with. The keys feel realistic and well weighted and the touch screen is icing on the cake. The B-3 is probably not what you want if you have a Casino Coupe or other small hollow body. Without front roller the break angle for the strings is pretty shallow. if you are an aggressive player you are going to be knocking some strings out of  saddle slots.  You may want to consider a Bigsby with front roller to increase string angle. Shipped purchased early Sunday morning and arrived Monday afternoon. Perfect pedal for live shows and recording. But the shipping impressed me. How can you go wrong with a Beatles pick? Update 9/7/15:  You know, weird thing... I originally bought my LPM that was of a lighter color, it was brown , same as the color in the back... And it had the hologram in the back... I recently returned it because the finish was chiping, and they gave me a new one that is waaaay darker in color, and it does not have the hologram in the back, is this because it\\'s older? The manufacture date says 9/14 ... Is that on the older side ? Did I get one that is not fully featured? Now I regret returning the original guitar I fell in love with.../:/  Awesome, amazing guitar... Blown away by the quality and attention to detail... And of course... The SOUND! But mine, I got a chip on the finish and I swear that happened inside the case... I had just cleaned it and it was all perfect, then I took it out and it had a big ol chip.... Such a shame, very beautiful finish sorry  but  wasnt made  right Great product, fast shipper I\\'ve gone through my share of headphones and these are the best pair I\\'ve owned to date. The bass is exceptional and everything sounds so clean no matter the level the volume is at. You can hear every instrument loud and clear. The fact that the fold is also pretty cool. They are very comfortable I\\'ve worn them for hours at a time and theyve never bothered me. They are well built and not flimsy at all.  The extra cords really come in handy as well. I am completely satisfied with this purchase About twice what should be paid for a nylon cover. I expected it to be much heavier. Nothing to say but this help me a lot to get the sound for GoPro. Haven\\'t try on the computer yet. Novelty item. Fun. The delay on it is bad enough to be annoying. Maybe with more practice, will get used to it, but if you are playing with other folks, that\\'s a problem. A friend of mines gave me these for my birthday, and I have been using them ever since. The sound quality is super good, as I can get really good bass with balanced mids and highs. These particular earbuds sound a lot better compared to others in their price range. The build quality is okay, as there is some cheap plastic being used, but its only a $20 set. The wires are strong, so you dont need to worry about breaking the wire when you remove the earbuds from your phone. Love it.  Wonderful Ocarina.  I love the color and sound.  A must have. Had mine a little over a year I think this is a terrific value for money, reasonably priced instrument. Tone is great, the stock strings good, nicely built. Clearly this is not a &#34;toy&#34; uke.  If you are expecting it to have the finish, feel and sound of a $1000 instrument, you\\'ll clearly be disappointed, but for an instrument that will play better than you can through the intermediate level and look great with a traditional finish too... you can\\'t go wrong here. These arrived quickly and my daughter loves them.  Good quality! Not very tough/tight  but it works for the price. Good price! Owned it before and still like using it. did not fit the Asus Thanks!<br />  LTS I was really pleased with this tuner. It cost about a third of what I paid for others and works great! great price Would be nice if a bit longer. I wanted to try something new so I gave this Jaw Harp a chance. It is pretty cool I will have to say. I have a lot of learning to do though. Make sure to follow instructions, also check online for other instructions and how to\\'s. wish it had the close lock though Great little mixer. It provided 48v phantom to my Shure SM7B and clear powerful sound. Much better then those USB to XLR sticks that are out there. You can add a little EQ as well. USB powered! You do have to crank it up fully to get the boost on my Shure SM7B mic but it doesn\\'t add noise and eliminates the need to boost the audio in post. Kids love it! It\\'s perfect for us. Use a CD-G (karaoke disc) and display on a big TV, or use YouTube FOR FREE and display on a tablet. Definitely buy an extra mic for the second input, though. Duets!! So far it\\'s been a good trombone my son . Thanks These are beautiful! Great quality and they were delivered in great shape! Good great This is a beautiful little instrument ...I haven\\'t plugged it in yet...looking forward to writing a review afterwards . Excellent product for the musican on the go giving your horn the same protection  of your hard case but ease of on the go. Great product, fast shipper Good. Durable. Incredible sound and out of the world quality for a bargain price. Plan to buy a range of sizes as budgets permit. The company accidentally sent me an alto instead of tenor. The alto sax was beautiful, the case very sturdy and came with everything pictured. Just wrong sax. Company refunded money quickly Good pick, durable non slip  !!! Makes lots of Noise while unit has nice features,, fan/power supply is loud this tuner is so easy to use.  and it is accurate. I recently got these headphones as a gift from my friend, so I decided to try them out. So far, I have been using this for a few weeks and I really like it! The sound quality is great, and it has tight bass with balanced mids and highs. The build quality is okay, but these dont cost a whole lot so I wouldn\\'t worry about it too much. Overall, it\\'s a great product for the money. Sounds good for practice. Hase a good variety of controls. They took us hours to do 1 strip, the self adhesive does not work, every glue we used does not work, what a headache The light spins faster than I was expecting.  Other than that we like it. Works great for charging our keyboard. The only issue we have is the cord is SUPER short. We have to plug it into an extension cord and then into the wall in order to use it. Otherwise, it gets the job done and lets our daughter practice her keyboard lessons by keeping the keyboard charged without pesky battery changes! GREAT product!  My son just started High School band and the director told us we must have 3.0 strength to hit the high notes.  I wish we would have known in Middle school :). Really works keeping the feedback down These Look amazing on my Taylor Guitar. Perfect Addition. Now it\\'s time to get a custom pick guard. Lol I use this equipment for a nursing home ministry.  Works excellent and has never let me down.  Good product yes man! Awesome device with very clear sound. Now i can practice without bothering anyone. I have been djing for over 16 years these are by far the strongest stands I have ever used I will be buying another pair of stands for my speakers. Great mic for doing audio or video interviews with your phone. I tested it using an iPhone 6. Audio was clear and clean for both people speaking without the annoying hiss and back ground noise that comes from the in phone mic. While I feel the distance between the mics is fine for interview work, the cable to the phone could use some extra length. I would highly suggest an extender cable to get the mic signal to a phone on a tripod.<br /><br />Love it and expect this twin much to become a much used item for me. Sound is as clear and as easy to use as the single mic Rodes I spent a lot more to purchase. Works great on removing and installing drum heads. I do genuinely like the strings, they are very &#34;focused&#34; and loud as sh**... However they bring out a LOT of high end. They have mellowed a bit, but I\\'ve had them on a MIM precision played through an Ampeg SVT II and an Ampeg 6x10, and had to roll my tone knob down quite a bit to compensate for the overwhelming highs. They feel great and seem to still have a lot of life in them. I\\'d ecommend them for more modern bass playing, but for gitty rock n roll, I will probably go elsewhere next time. Sounds very good - arrived sooner than anticipated.  Thanks! Best price out there! Works great. Perfect fit for my 6-string Ibanez bass. Great upgrade/replacement speaker for a Fender 25R - breaks up nicely at lower volumes while still maintaining nice crisp highs.<br /><br />The mounting holes lined up perfectly and there are twice as many as needed for most applications (eight lug holes, but most cabinets only use four).<br /><br />I would have given five stars, but I was a little disappointed to discover this speaker is made in China - If I had known that before ordering,. I would have bought an Eminence speaker (USA) [[ASIN:B0009H00WW Eminence Patriot Ragin Cajun 10&#34; Guitar Speaker, 75 Watts at 8 Ohms]]. Love these headphones for work. Great sounding head phones! When I used to work in the studio years ago we always used these. And they still sound great. Love this shirt and came on time. This thing will make any room, or any object you place it behind, a LOT more prominent and interesting. The LED behavior manages to be unpredictable yet reactive in a way that makes it feel a bit like a \\'toy\\', in a good way. It\\'s blinding to look right at this thing, and the light is somewhat directional without a reflector to help it out, so you\\'ll want to mount it very carefully and pay attention (whilst standing back) to see how it looks.<br />Great device, lots of fun. Was expecting it to be lesser quality than what I could get at the big box places... nope, seems to be exact same thing. But I saved a couple bucks, so I\\'m happy. great sound better then the other  cheep ones I replace. Amazing cymbal, crash/ride explosive ! best headphones I have owned.  They sound awesome. nice sound Went out on a limb and got this for my wife\\'s Cordoba Concert Uke and it fits pretty near perfectly. Looks nice, will buy again for my brother-in-law. very  good. Thanks I have had a few other ocarinas, one of them was STL Ocarina. This one is by far the best I have ever played. I am a part time musician so I actually record my instruments as well, and this one sounds perfectly in tune. Rarely do I find that! The picks are fine. I thought I would be getting multicolored picks but they all came in green , I don\\'t really mind thought, just saying. It\\'s an alignment gauge for any turntable that uses a 15mm overhang.  It will set your cartridge to an alignment that minimizes distortion for 12&#34; records.  If the effective length of your tonearm is 230 mm and your overhang is 15mm, then this is a tool you need to have to optimize your turntable\\'s playback.<br /><br />Having your cartridge out of alignment not only sounds horrible but can damage your precious, irreplaceable vinyl. I anticipated a Ukulele strap that would work for an adult. The one I received isn\\'t anywhere near long enough for me to use. I didn\\'t see anything in the Amazon listing to indicate that it was so short. High quality trumpet bag for my 4th grader to lug around at school. It feels pretty durable, and he is able to easily carry it around with him. I can see this bag lasting a long time. Highly recommend! Great product, fast shipper Love this Mic. Looks great and works amazinggggggggg Performs as Yamaha designed it. Wish the rest of my vintage, Slingerland, Phantom series was this clear.  Sounds great. Awesome product! Made my lights that much better! Very well made.  The stand adjusts easily with minimum effort while at the same time supporting several music books and an iPad. As awesome of a mic as everyone said. Glad i bought it! This is a big, sturdy boom. Will support a heavy microphone without a problem. Does a great job. I have both a Heil PR781 and a Shure Super 55 and works perfectly with both! Great product, fast shipper I love these strings! Beautiful sound, rich tone AAAAA+++++ Great beginners mandolin, I play guitar and wanted to get out of a creative rut and learn something new. I was originally looking at the cheapest mandolin available (won\\'t mention any names) and based on recommendations from players on mandolin blog and chat sites decided to go one level up. Boy am I glad I did because I found this beauty. I found the fit and finish on this mandolin outstanding with no blemishes. The Tabaco sunburst is subdued compared to a standard sunburst, I like that. It only needed a quick tuning and intonation setup and it was ready to play. A real bonus is its amp and recording ready. The picture shows what appears to be a standard single coil magnetic pickup but mine came with a under saddle piezio pickup and it sounds great amped. Make no mistake, this is an entry level mandolin but that is exactly what I wanted as I wasn\\'t sure if I would continue to play it for the long term. Now I\\'m sure I will continue to play this mandolin frequently and hopefully for a very long time. I bought this product today. The worst possible. I am pretty tech savvy. No possible way to set this up. But, please go to their website. Here\\'s what you will experience.... Buy this, buy that, buy more. Of course your product doesn\\'t work.... but if you buy more it will. Really we promise. Avoid at all costs. Awesome gift for any guitar player! Worked beautifully for my King 2-B! Fast Shipping! Product is as described! Ok The one I got was well in tune (within 1/100 cent), and still is, over a year later. Compare its sound to a 440hz sine wave and you\\'ll hear very VERY little intermodulation between the two. I\\'ve used it to tune guitars and such, where it did well. Its sound lasts long enough to sample a good sustained tone for musical applications. What I needed! the product was not satified with the amount i paid...too much feed back, i the mic volumes was not loud and mixed in with the music beat. I just received mine last week. It shipped fast, it is beautiful! I\\'m a beginner teaching myself, so tuning it was easy with the digital tuner that comes with it.<br />My only complaint is it arrived with one missing fine tuner, I made do by adjusting one string to where I needed it then I switched so I could tune the other. I would suggest watch a lot of YouTube videos on How To adjust and learn your strings & when to use your rosin. You\\'ll need it before you can hear sound on the beginner violin.<br />Wish it came with a book; I\\'d be ready to go... Have not used it long. It appears to be what I was looking for. Bought this when my son was 4 months old. While he will look at these noise makers when I shake them, he has no interest in them on his own (he is now almost 7 months old). I do wish the rain maker was longer, it seems entirely too short. Perhaps this is a toy he will &#34;grow&#34; in to as he gets older. The Fishman Aura Spectrum DI preamp is a must-have if you play an acoustic/electric guitar. The difference in tone from an under-saddle pickup or sound-hole pickup is simply amazing! You DO actually get a microphone sound and any piezo pickup &#34;quack&#34; or electronic-produced sound can be blended out of your guitar\\'s pickup. I have Takamine acoustic-electric guitars and Guild acoustic-electric guitars and they sound exceptional when plugged into this preamp. Before you purchase this preamp, go to Fishman\\'s website (http://www.fishman.com/products/view/aura-spectrum-di) and review the product information and then download the Aura Gallery III to your computer and scan through all the selections available to you for use with your guitar. Some very high-end microphones were used by Fishman to develop this imaging preamp ($4,000 microphones in some cases). Also, browse Youtube to find out more about this preamp....you won\\'t regret your purchase of this preamp. One additional bit of advise......before you decide to spend money for a new guitar, buy this preamp and &#34;dial in&#34; some images to play through your old guitar. I think you\\'ll find that you won\\'t need a new guitar after having a chance to hear your old guitar plugged into this preamp and run through your PA or amplifier.  If you want your acoustic-electric guitar to sound like it is being recorded in a studio with high-end microphones, this is your preamp! Love th is light and charging system!  Best book/bed time reading light I\\'ve ever used. The light is worth the price and perfect for inserting under the scrim skirts AMAZING! my kids use it with their piano teacher! my kids are on level 7 and just starter 9 months ago GREAT SELLER PRODUCT WORKED GREAT Repeat purchase.  Works great. great A lot of people really like this Sound System.  I\\'m only giving it 3 Stars because I have listened to the Bose Wave and there is simply no comparison.  I have this Marshall set up in my bedroom, 11x14.  Centered on the headboard wall with at least 6&#34; off the backside.  I get serious distortion if I try and crank it up past 4-5 on the Volume.  Does it sound crisp and clear when below that volume?  Absolutely.  However, I have heard numerous Bose Waves cranked up in the same environment and there is simply no comparison.  Will I keep this Marshall?  Yup.  Looks cool and at least meets my minimum expectations. Just what I needed Received the items as described.  I would buy from this seller again. What an amazing Guitar - The rosewood not only is a beautiful deep dark color, but it has a deep clean seductive sound that makes each note you play sound better.  The finish is excellent, and the 1-7/8&#34; nut is the perfect compromise between a classical guitar and a popular steel string size of 1-11/16&#34;. good Nice, fast shipping good quality Very sensitive device.  Picks up EVERYTHING, with extraordinary clarity.  So, I\\'m building my own private sound booth. This is perfect for an inexpensive carry on stand. I love it. Run a little small. Don\\'t bother  Wasted my $$ Fantastic quality. Have had mine for years and it protects my tables perfectly. Only gripe is it gets a bit heavy with all of the gear inside. But it\\'s so nice to just open a lid and plug in power and you are ready to go. Great quality and works well. I have half a dozen capos of various styles and these are better than any of them.  They work simply and securely. Good quality It\\'s hard to find an octave harmonica at a decent price.  Tremolo harmonicas are everywhere, but not octave harmonicas.  So I bought this, for just a couple dollars, so see what an octave harmonica sounded like.  The quality of this is not very good, with some notes not playing the upper octave, and it takes a LOT of air to play.  So much so that it is hard to sustain a note for even a full second.  I really don\\'t see this as a playable instrument, and to give this to a beginner would probably just frustrate them.  I did end up buying another octave harmonica by Tombo, and the difference was like night and day... much easier to play.... but also much more expensive.  In hindsight I probably wasted my money on this, but maybe I might take it apart someday and see if I can get it to pay properly. Seismic Audio make great quality cables I\\'m a little disappointed with the battery life on these. Even if I don\\'t use them, they seem to lose charge when they are off so I always need to charge before I\\'m going to use them.  Aside from that, they have performed really well. I LOVE the sound from them, the bass booms and highs are rich. If they didn\\'t sound so good, I might have stopped using them, but it\\'s a fair trade off to have to charge them. Works great exactly what I wanted. This is a perfect beginner guitar.  It comes ready to tune and play with everything needed.  My son wanted to learn to play.  So, without spending a fortune, he is able to try it and see if he loves it or not before spending money on a more expensive instrument. Excellent device It sound  very good, all the holes are functional, Easy to play. Everything I expected it to be - I use it to support a 24&#34; LED monitor and a Behringer personal audio monitor control. leans a little does not stand straight Excellent product! Nice quality product. I\\'ve tried loads of tuners, however, as other reviewers have said, this is the best. Don\\'t bother with anything else, just get this. The guitar has excellent finish and nice finish on the frets no ruff edges nice. would of gave more stars but the action on the strings was way to high tried to lower them and the hit the pickup. Could not be lowed enough it would come undone from the pickup and still to high it still hit the strings. I had to use a pickup mounting plate that I had. The one I had was vintage witch matched the binding great and is much lower in height then the black one that came with it. The bridge is slammed  down to the bottom and still the strings are to high. Looking for a lower bridge, but it is now playable. It is a great looking guitar much better looking then any Fender squire, vintage or standard or other wise. Just has cheep bridge hardware. the bridge design is bad with the hardware used. The pickup are not that great sound cheep. will be changing them as well. Then I will have the Tele of my dreams Very nice quality, real leather and a strong button. pretty hardcore stand, tougher than it looks like This product worked just as advertised. First I must comment on all the reviews stating that this is a &#34;REAL iRIG!!!&#34;  That is not a review of the quality of the product.  Only the name printed on it.  Who cares if it\\'s a real iRig if it\\'s still crap?<br /><br />The one I got did come in an iRig package if that for some reason matters to you.  But it cracks a lot while recording and there almost no isolation between the headphones and microphone.  So expect anything sent to your headphones (like maybe a metronome click track) to also be recorded (at a slightly lower volume than your actual input).<br /><br />I gave it two stars because it is really cheap, so I don\\'t feel like I was really ripped off.  It may have some limited uses for someone out there. Its really pretty good, I cant complain to much.. as far as learning how to program it, the instructions are pretty basic and a trip to You Tube land would help you a little. and to figure out how to program the joystick,,,, you might want to talk to Chauvet directly as I could fine ZERO info on line about how to do this. other then that its well worth the money I think, but the speed and fader sliders are not as sensitive as I would like then to be. but other than that , they say 4 or 5 day shipping, I got mine in two days.  if you have some intelligent lighting such as moving fixtures, this will work. as described So far so Good! The effect is nice and subtle when needed, love the small size Product works fine. Great tool to use on guitars!!!! Perfect to play back from old cassettes Good for the price. She loves the violin but when she went to class today the teacher said &#34;its missing the bridge&#34; can the seller please contact me on how to fix this. Thank you. GREAT SELLER PRODUCT WORKED GREAT I\\'m just a beginner on the guitar, but I like this one a lot. The strings are a little further apart, which is good for hybrid/finger-picking. The guitar looks nice and seems pretty sturdy. It also comes with good pickups and does not weigh too much. Have been using for about a month and I\\'m getting solid results.<br />I have worked my way up to doing 2-3 sets of 200-300 quick full<br />pumps (all the way up and all the down) with each foot. Quite a workout.<br />The spring gives plenty of resistance. I had a very weak right foot/ shin but no more. Drumming feels so much more natural and easy now that right foot will<br />(generally) do what I want. All Great well made Tascam customer service is horrible, I have reached out to them twice and have posted on their FB and yet they never replied. Wifi function on my recorder does not work and no one from Tascam has reached out how to resolve that. This Ukulele is honestly one of the best I have played, it\\'s extremely easy to play, and the tone is honestly pretty good. You get what you pay for. And the pictures don\\'t do this Ukulele justice at all, the color hues are far more vibrant. You get what you pay for. Exellent!!! Great value and works perfectly!  Good quality! Best bass cabinet I have ever owned.  Aguilar is second to none when it comes to bass. This is a beautiful design, and very durable.<br /><br />PROS:<br />*You can fold it up and pack it easily into your laptop bag.<br />*Looks professional<br />*High Quality Design<br />*Will Last 7-10 Years of Use<br />*Perfect Height for Laptop over the DJ Mixer<br /><br />CONS:<br />*Not adjustable, but you won\\'t need to adjust it. I bought one of these on e-bay for less than half the price-- same manufacturer (Angel), and I think the same model (AD-1D), although it\\'s hard to see the model number in the picture of the case.<br /><br />It took me a while to be able to produce a nice tone reliably, which surprised me, since I have played the similar Chinese xiao and Japanese shakuhachi. This required a very narrow and carefully shaped stream of air.<br /><br />It\\'s hard to be sure-- an experienced player might be able to get much nicer sounds out of it-- but I think it is a fairly limited instrument for beginners. In comparison, you can buy a plastic soprano recorder for anywhere from about 3 or 4 dollars to about 30 dollars. A 30-dollar plastic soprano recorder is a very good instrument, better than wood recorders up to five times as expensive. A 5-dollar plastic recorder is a toy-- even the best of recorder players can\\'t really make music on it. I suspect that this danso is comparable in quality to a low-end plastic recorder, but I don\\'t really know that for sure, not having played a better instrument. It doesn\\'t seem capable of much variation in loudness or tone color. This was a great guitar. Nylon strings were very easy on the fingers when I first started out. Did not have a thumb pick and i was expecting one. I\\'ve bought this for my son and he loves it. Even his teacher said it\\'s a fantastic sticks. Apparently this is the only collaboration between Yoshiki (from X-Japan) and drum label, so if you are into drumming, you probably want to treat yourself with these Tama drum sticks. These arrived quickly and my daughter loves them.  Good quality! Worked, technically, for some months before very gentle use somehow caused the cable to sever somewhere inside the insulation. The cable was rarely even moved and never manipulated into harsh angles. Even on first use, the connection was loose. Whether or not it was a defective unit, it was certainly cheaply made. Grate tuners no problems , Thanks Perfect for my Strad! You get what you pay for!  Very thin base plate, half as thick as my original and it was painted, not powder coated. I used the saddles and tossed the rest. Good and delevery on time , good sound for what I needed My kids always want a night light all over the house when it\\'s bed time. They would prefer if we left all the lights on but that is not happening. I love this little night like it is just bright enough too be able to see when you walk through the living room to go to the bath room. I love how it is small but packs a powerful light. This is a great product and it does have several modes i use the light off mode. So when light turns off it comes on. It takes 3 AAA which are not included. It does have 3 other modes but I haven\\'t messed with them much as this one works wonders for our family. I got this at a discount for my unbiased review. These Headphones are the best thing I own. They mold to you so well, it\\'s like having bionic ears. Brilliant. Total silence in the effect chain. I had a Dunlop Brick previously which was ok but was still noisy. One downside is that wah pedals don\\'t like being near it when they\\'re switched on. They produce a loud hum when they\\'re engaged so make sure you put the unit as far as possible away from the wah. They\\'re totally silent when not engaged. I am a pianist and bought this to record myself playng with good quality sound and minimal background noise.  What a great product!  You can adjust the record levels so (my grand piano) your sound source does not overwhelm the device and cause crackles in the playback.  You can also record as .mp3 at varying levels of precision (ie memory space), same for .wav.  And you can convert one to the other within the device.  The visual interface is not that user friendly, but the user manual is comprehensive.  And you can download onto your PC and upload onto iTunes, creating your own playlists of your playing or send .mp3s to friends or teachers over email to let them hear your progress.  Plus just listening to myself from a recording is so edifying.  I love this little device.  Came fast and free with Prime.  Thanks Amazon! A fantastic product for the price. Buffalo bones is so easy to work with. It begs to be molded and crafted to the artisan\\'s hands. I bought several extra for the price. Very handy to keep around!! Worked as expected.  I\\'ve cut of the tip of a black flushy sock and using a rubber band to hold it on, I adjusted the sound to perfection. Audio quality is terrible, won\\'t charge while running Didn\\'t work to well sound quality is okay at best-  documentation and instructions are weak- lacking Great piano for begginers! Very nice bow for the price! Disappointed with the performance. Muddy, with little high range Leaks and makes a mess! Good strong adjustable bench. Well made. The quality of the instrument is good. The instructions were not easy to follow. I had to do a web search to complete assembly. this was for my neighbor. he is in the school band. [ he is good ] he said these work very good for the type of drumming he does. This was a pretty neat item for the cost, it is a bit cheaply made and we had to tape the top back on but the kids thought it was cool and it made the party cooler! TY! This thing is amazing. I have a gain hungry mic and the cloudlifter makes it so much better! One thing to be aware of though; it needs power and doesn\\'t have a way to add external power. Most interfaces have phantom power BUT if your interface is USB powered than this can cause some grief. My advice is to always use an externally powered interface whenever possible. Since I switched to an externally powered interface I have had zero issues with the cloudlifter/mic combo and it sounds amazing. This was  gift for my grandson, he liked it very much. The service was great. Thank you very much. Wonderful ocarina and finely tuned.  A must have. Excellent cables, work great. No static, no distortion. Very happy with my purchase, bought 3. Item arrived on time. Bought this for a Karaoke party I hosted and it was a hit!  Dimmed the lights and felt like we were at a Karaoke bar without the pressure of leaving and tipping the staff! great buy, very great buy! my son loves these sticks.  I bought them because i liked the red on them but he loves the comfort of them.  he drums a couple of  hours everyday. Bright exciting lights that were easy to decorate with. this case help to store and transport the clarinet without disassemble.  the clarinet is ez to assemble but very hard to disassemble because it stuck very firm together and if you use force with limited grip you will bend the keys.  so it is better leave it assembled and save time. first one came broken, they replaced it and it works like it should. Super cheesey..all plastic no metal. good quality Love these and they sound awesome.  I bought two to use with the Monoprice 110951 PA system and the worked great. No background noise was heard through them, just the person singing or talking. Loved that you can turn them off and on, a big plus.  My son-in-law made a nice comment about them and informed me that these are top quality mics and wish he had some like that for his karaoke set up. The strap works just fine and I would recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />Only problem is that the string it comes with is not durable at all. It snapped literally 5 minutes after I first set it up and started playing it. But that was fine, as the main product is the strap and I had more durable string lying around the house. GREAT SELLER PRODUCT WORKED GREAT Ive been playing for 5 years, and these are absolutely fantastic. Compared to your typical vandoren box with 3-4 good reeds, it\\'s more like 7-8 with Rigotti. Very even tone across all ranges and no chips breaks or moldy cane. If you play with cane, thsee are the reeds to get. My son loved it because it was heavy and made really well and works really well. Did not fit. I bought the volca bass by mistake (I was actually looking for the volca sample for my project), but damn that thing was the best - excellent fat bass sounds, beautiful tweets, far easier to use and get started than the volca keys, far more responsive to just noodling around to get improvised bass-lines. The only thing I\\'d change about it is to have a midi-out as standard (there are mod-kits to add this) and have SD-card capabilities to expand the pattern memory options. Good sound, but they fit awkwardly on my ears. Not very comfortable... I probably wouldn\\'t enjoy using these for long recording sessions so I gave them to my fiancÃ© for gaming. My son finds it helpful. Seems to be of good quality too. just new to clarinet --wanted 1.5 reeds --these super Smooth sound quality,  great bass strings,  good combination. The strap is well made and durable, but about 6&#34; too short for a little overweight adult male.  I had to tie a boot lace to it to make it longer to set my guitar at a comfortable height. This is decent and easy to put together but the metal bars are uneven after attaching them together. This causes the whole stand to move each time a key is pressed down. Had to put something underneath 2 bars to make them even. Overall, this seems sturdy but could have been better made. This electronic piano is the best.  I love it with its many features and options.  It is wonderful.  Such a great investment.  I am really learning to playt he piano with it and enjoy every new feature I learn. I didn\\'t work when I got it. There was no loaded programs, no battery for stored memory, and the card loader wouldn\\'t load those programs that I had. So because I am a electronic technician I decided to try and fix the M1R EX synthesizer module rather than send it back. Ultimately I was able to restore the card loader but it was really in need of replacing. I put a battery in it and all was well for storing the loaded memory. Also the picture that they posted of this unit was not the same one that I received. The unit needed a lot of restoration work before I could look at it with a pleasing eye, but I was able to restore it. This is not they way to do business by lying about the product your are trying to sell and charging way too much for something that they knew didn\\'t work to begin with. Amazing cymbal, crash/ride explosive ! Crap product. Doesn\\'t hold the weight of any decent microphone. Fantastic system. I am converting all my guitars to this. Seller contacted me regarding options and we swapped emails.  Article was as described.  No problems noted. I found these cans to be all around excellent.  Great build quality for $100, and the sound quality is top notch.  In this price range you can\\'t beat them.<br /><br />I see some folks complaining about comfort, but I wear these almost everyday and they are fine for me.  Very comfortable.  Maybe it depends on the size of your head and ears, but I have no issue with the way these fit.<br /><br />Deep bass and rich sounds.  Get them now.  Oh and the long (detachable) cord is perfect for me too - love it! It\\'s a good product.  Nice and bright and good price. Good quality. Prompt delivery. Much appreciated! Different. Cheaply made. Design nice. Great strings. Fast delivery Not bad for the price, but not great either.<br /><br />The build quality seems a little flimsy, in particular if you pick up the whole stand, the bottom u-shaped bar falls out pretty easily...  you\\'ll want to be careful it\\'s properly inserted into the main post before you put your guitar on the stand (especially if you just moved the stand).<br /><br />This is a nitpick put the plastic foam material stank (off-gassed) pretty badly for the first few weeks. Awesome. Good quality, great price. These things are perfect. So easy to put on and they really make sure your straps stay where they should. I don\\'t know why people would spend more on other strap locks. This is one of the two best plastic soprano recorders available, and is a much better value for the money than less expensive plastic sopranos. The only plastic soprano comparable to it is the 300 series Yamaha soprano. Personally, I prefer the range of tone color on the Yamaha, but this instrument also has a good range of tone color. The great advantage of this instrument over the Yamaha is that there are several pitches which tend to be problematic on all recorders-- even good wooden instruments-- especially the high C near the top of the instrument, and the G# below that-- and these pitches sound quite clearly and easily on this instrument. I would choose it over the Yamaha for any piece involving fast passage work in the top register.<br /><br />There are better wooden instruments, of course, but one has to pay at least $100 for anything better than this. I think it is a great fortune to be able to buy an instrument this good for between $20 and $30 (the price fluctuates quite a bit), and I would recommend it without hesitation to anyone who wants to learn to play the recorder, or to any experienced player who wants a plastic instrument as a backup. I love it !!! I purchased this item for my grand-daughter\\'s 13th birthday.  She loved it. Great beginner violin. She had it out, strung, and was already learning to play &#34;recognizable&#34; music.  Our kids said it is well made, especially for a beginner.  It arrived on time...I am very pleased with this purchase. Very comfortable, looks sharp.<br />Has plenty of length too. i am very satisfy from this item<br />thank you<br />J Stossel Works great, no complaints, holds my hollowbody firmly with no issues, even with super old, crumbly walls. Great Product I have relied on the Snark tuners for years because they are reliable and inexpensive enough where I can keep one in each instrument\\'s case. However, the notion of polytuning sparked my curiosity, and I found this device helpful. It has a couple of problems. Sometimes, when I strum all the strings, not all of them appear on the display. It also often happens that after individually tuning each string, I notice that strumming suggests that a couple of strings may be instantly out of tune again. For the most part, however, I have found tuning much easier and quicker with this device than with the Snark tuners. Also, although it is meant for six-string guitars, I found it an accurate tuner for my twelve-string guitar and mandolin, although the polytune function, of course, does not work for those. Welll first off i think these were not new from factory. Small Phillips screws didnt line up with originals. I put them on a dean dime, they dont stay in tune very well. Not bad, they are way better than chinese cheap crap that comes on guitars. But i was hoping for better results. This is the best clip-on tuner I have used, and I have tried a few. I just did an outdoor gig with it on my acoustic, and the accuracy and functionality of the readout surpassed anything else I have used (Snark, Intellitouch, etc.) I was in bright sunlight, and I could read the display no problem. As I tuned each string, the display needle held steady and guided me to a more accurate tuning than I used to get with the Snark-and it was quicker too. The &#34;polytune&#34; function is useful, but it is not the real star of the show. The real reason to buy this tuner is because it works way better than it\\'s competition, and is easy to read. Not sure yet if it is as good or better than the TC or Boss pedal tuners (both excellent), but it is certainly close. GREAT CABLE, GREAT PRICE.. stylish too.. No need expensive tuner, this is exactly what I want, cheap and easy to use. I am a classical percussionist, and I was recording a prescreen audition and needed an analog to digital converter, because my old laptop was picking up way too much computer noise. When I first got the Icicle, I noticed that there is zero metal on the body of the device - it\\'s all chrome-painted plastic. And the particular device I received was rattling as if something inside was broken. So first off, the build quality makes it feel like a cheap toy. The recording quality was okay, albeit a bit noisy, for higher-pitched instruments. HOWEVER, when recording warm, lower-pitched instruments, like timpani and marimba, the Icicle provided its own soundtrack of buzzy feedback that could not be fixed, no matter what settings I tried. I bought a $400 mic for this recording project, and this Icicle made it sound like a $50 mic. If you need a quick, cheap device for simple, lo-fi recordings, this would be it - but you\\'re wasting your money if you think you can get a good quality recording from this toy. My grand daughter loves this toy! Looks great with my desk! I have been buying these strings for years for a Jazz Bass and have never been happier.  The coating is great, looks awesome but doesn\\'t have that coated feel.  They are also very durable, I was regularly going through strings using &#34;slap and pop&#34; techniques and these hold up much better.  For my other basses I use the black ones to match better.  I\\'ll never buy a different brand of strings again. Recommend not buying...the plastic will eventually &#34;melt&#34;  causing an extremely sticky material that you will not be able to touch without having the residue on your hands.  I called the company:  the singing machine to discuss and they tried to blame it on me and how it was stored.  It\\'s poor plastic but they won\\'t admit it. Best headphones I have had by far. They\\'re wayyyy better than beats and outlast them by far. I\\'ve had mine for about 2 years and every time I listen to them I\\'m always in heaven. They\\'re crystal clear and have a good amount of bass. The headsets I received were not the same model as illustrated. The plug has 3 conductors (like a stereo headset) and WILL NOT WORK with a device designed to provide mic DC power on the plug tip and sleeve (2 conductor). I ordered this and recieved a few days later. Very good quick service. It looks and sounds great I love it!! Highly recommended to nintendo collectors or zelda fans in general. The great thing with this ukulele stand is that it folds really small & takes up very little room. Have been using the Blue Yeti USB mic for a couple of months and we just love it. Stoopid good! Great! Exceed my expectations in comparison to others I\\'ve seen. Excellent  product at a great price. Shipped fast and arrived in short time. Excellent cymbal for crash/trashy patterns. The remote didn\\'t work at all and the bluetooth only went about 10 feet after passing through a wall. Sound was good but overall it\\'s cheaper/better to buy a amplifier and a separate bluetooth receiver. Worked well while they lasted. Can expect them to last about 2 years. Still haven\\'t gotten a chance to test it out since my guitar broke, but it\\'s a study product. It works great. Thank you Great gift filled the bill!!! Be warned that you need a power supply for this pedal. That said, it is great.I use it to kill the signal when using the same cable to switch fro guitar to ukulele. Good beginner\\'s instrument Works great enjoy being able to hook my phone up to the transmitter and play music through my amp to practice along with Does NOT fit LG G3 VS985 (Verizon). This case is about1&#34; too short. Awesome! Light & easy to use. Support feet very wide when opened so it becomes awkward in crowded pit work. Stays up when extended as long as you don\\'t overload. A lot of features on this mixer for the money.  You can\\'t go wrong with a Mackie product. The engraving actually catches the strings. Otherwise good. just received this amp today Aug 31, 2015.<br />Using this amp primarily for electronic Pyle Pro PED02 drums.<br />Very loud, plenty of punch power for small to medium size crowds, maybe even larger crowds.<br /><br />Amp has plenty of preset sounds to choose.<br />I\\'m really a big fan of the TurboSound brand quality.<br />Good solid thump and great low and mid tone.<br />The tweeter does produce that high end thrash from drum cymbals.<br />Both speakers throw out a very realistic sound.<br />I\\'ve also used this amp for my guitars too and the rocks out like a pro.<br /><br />The sub woofer output jack is very good to have and my Pyle Pro drums have a few preset sound modes that produce very low end sub woofer sound. So hooking a powered sub woofer to this amp really let the system blast clearly with powerful muscle.<br />The quality is instantly noticeable just looking at it. The functions and sounds prove it.<br /> I would give this amp a 10 star rating if I could and I highly recommend this for the frugal consumer. The cost seems high but really not if<br /> comparing the quality and the expected years of use from it.<br /><br />pro\\'s - just a good powerful amp with great sound.<br /><br />cons - I don\\'t really care for the preset sound button and having to scroll through so many to get the desired effect.<br />example: wanting to quickly switch between modes takes time.<br />  alternative is to choose the sounds I prefer and use each sound on each of the out pout channels, then just turn on or up the channel<br />  output that I want for the moment and play. Since there\\'s only four output channels, my choices are limited.<br />  But I\\'m okay with it since the Amp is such a nice quality build. Good Great product. Awesome little guy does it job! This head was perfect for use on my djembe. It was easy to work, pulled tight, and produces great low-end and nice highs. The price was very reasonable. Gets lots of compliments but the settings are finicky and like to change on their own. Great price, outstanding product I am having so much fun with my didgeridoo, I just. Learned how to blow in it, great vibration I have tried a lot of different headphones.  My main ones for years were Beyerdynamic DT770s.  I borrowed three sets of Ultrasones (ranging in price from $700-$1500) from a friend.  These made me realize how much high end definition was missing in my DT770s.  At the same time, the mids sounds horribly scooped in the Ultrasones.  The Focal Spirit Professional headphones are giving me the best of both worlds.  Simply put, they sound balanced from top to bottom.  The detail is there.  And I have to say the transient response is better than any other headphones I\\'ve heard.  They\\'re also incredibly efficient.  I let my friend who lent me the Ultrasones check out the Focals, and he, within a very short duration of listening to them, decided he needed a pair.<br /><br />The only downside is they\\'re not the most comfortable headphones to wear for extended periods of time.  I guess I was spoiled in that regard with my DT770s.<br /><br />Anyway, these are winners for me. Pleasantly surprised at how well this reed responds and sounds. I would probably order a 4 next time. It met my cheap but reliable marching brass needs Cheap crape took for ever not worth even 10 cents Beautiful kit! Couldn\\'t be happier! Great starter projector light. Only reason I did not give five stars is the lack of options and directions that did not arrive with the light. And while it looks great, I don\\'t  necessarily want them or spell out \\'Welcome\\' every time I use it. If anyone has instructions, feel free to correct me or send a link.<br /><br />We also want to note the primary mount is quite flimsy, so be careful when handling. Movable padded divider helps support mutes. Won\\'t be good for a mute freak but holds my straight, cup & Harmon no problem (as well as a bottle of water). Clips to my gig bag well but I really don\\'t trust the plastic clip. I got a carabineer clip to use. These strings are great, happy I bought them. Ok I like it. Thank you! Great device and great sound. Easy to use, too. I was playing some Hendrix yesterday using the JH 1500 recreation of his amp in Amplitube and had my kids listen in. I told them they\\'re lucky to live in a time when this amp on my phone is $15 and I could NEVER afford the real thing What can I say, it does the job. Distinctive cover makes it easy to find in the pile of wires. I wish this had an automatic shut off timer after a certain amount of time. My kids love this toy but if they forget to turn it off the battery runs out quick :( product was arrived on time.....machine was not that impressive for the amount i paid. Just what father-in-law was looking for. The mic arrived quickly and I think it\\'s a great mic. It\\'s quite hot, I\\'d say on par with the Shure beta 58a and some condenser mics, and very clear with less proximity effect than the Shure. I like it a lot. Ok<br />headphones It was a gift . There was no complaints so neither do I. It was shipped in a timely fashion Is not so easy to configure for DJ Pro. GOOD QUALITY Son is a drummer and uses these a lot. Have purchased so many I\\'ve lost count. Great price. Will buy again! Lol worked great for about 2 months then the volume went out Looks nice but you can\\'t even play it or tune it properly because the strings are far too high off the neck. The kids have never been happier!  Very easy to move around and hook up.  The microphone isn\\'t as great as it could be but it\\'s not terrible.  Can add a second mic and it hooks up to most phones/iPods/etc.  I wanted one that doesn\\'t display the words ON the machine but a tv or laptop instead so this was absolutely perfect. beswt for the buck We got two of these to fill up a huge room with blacklight and it worked like a charm! These things are powerful! Was perfect for our blacklight party and people loved the look! Fender picks: Some years ago Fender picks changed their shape,they were a bit pointier and had a little scratchier sound,but these made in China picks ,at least the ones I bought, are back to the original more rounded tip that I like.They wear very well like they had been polished without the rough edges at all.I have the premium celluloid in white perloid,red,purple and tortoise shell and they are great,the abalones are very good too.The tortoise shell are exactly the same as the Martin celluloid ,just as the old ones,perhaps you got some bad ones from some years back,but the new ones they sell now everywhere are as good as the old ones. good  price Really works keeping the feedback down purchased this for our 7 year old who started piano lessons recently. this is very easy to use, easy to set up, no tools needed. and a great price too! This is a great unit for the price.  Does everything I need  Recommend it. They are exactly like the original. They work great. What can I say...it\\'s a protection plan.  Want know how good it is until I have a problem. Will not fit Epiphone SG SPECIAL as advertised. Love the mixer!! The best guitar strings! Nice!!! Gives my phone classy bling! Love it! This thing is fantastic! It makes a small fender sidekick sound like a big stack amp on recordings.  It is the best pedal I\\'ve used. Woks as expected for a 100$ turntable Excellent for gaming. wow<br />I was going to get a gaming headset, and read that normal headphones are much better value for money. These are so good for sound, you dont need the virtual surround garbage headset. Great light!! About the size of a Standard size light bulb. Also Its just as bright as the sunjack light, but for a fraction of the cost. Only problem i had was that the cord was very short which would make it hard to hang on something over 7ft high, say a 10x20 tent. Useful. As described by seller. Our daughter loves it.  It takes up so much less space and she\\'s not embarrassed to take it on the school bus.  It doesn\\'t hurt her back as much as she can sling it. Product was put together fairly well! Only complaint I have is with the Floyd &#34;rose&#34;. The hole for the trem bar became loose after a few uses and it would go out of tune severely as well. If not for those issues I would have rated a 5 instead of a 4 This thing is a flat out life saver. I will ALWAYS have this in my case.. FORERVER Was exactly as described.  A bit slow to arrive but I was informed of this when I purchased so was not surprised.  Great price Has a warm and excelent performance. I replaced AT95E for this one, and it is impressive the diference, go for shure M97xE. A low budget solution Worked as expected This is the real deal. Reminds me of my first Gibson from back in the 70\\'s. Great feel and playability. It\\'s a Gibson through and through. Basic, yes. But that\\'s the beauty. Unbelievable for the price. It\\'s good. Working as expected. I just got these. I have not installed them ... yet.  They look great!  I would order 2 sets next time.  The ones that I ordered came from Malaysia.  So this took a little longer than the average Amazon order.  Worth the wait! The guitar is awesome, but the bag is smaller the guitar - useless. The strap is so loose that your guitar will fall off from your shoulders one day. I would recommend buying this guitar seperately and buying other things as you like As advertised Nice headphones. I\\'m using these for my iPhone 6+ and it sounds great. High quality instruments at prices that encourage children to learn to play them. They also will follow-up with you to ensure you are getting along well with it. Great company that provide a great instrument. I use this controller with MuseScore and am satisfied with it to date. Purchases for a 2 year olds birthday.. he loves to play drums... He totally loves them.  they are just the right size for him with growing room This little speaker might seem small and deceiving at first, I was a little worried. But, it worked great for a wedding ceremony. It is really loud and we had it at less than 1/2 power for a guest count of 150 at an outdoor wedding.<br /><br />The mics are decent as well and we had zero problems with them. The instructions aren\\'t clear on how to charge the unit bu you have to have it plugged in and in the on position for it to charge. When I received this flute you could tell that the workmanship was shoddy. The holes were weird distances from each other and drilled all willy-nilly. Seriously, this looks like a 6th graders industrial arts project. Doesn\\'t even play. Pass on this and save your money. I ordered this harmonium and was delighted with the speed and care with which it was shipped, all the way from India. It has a very nice tone and I like the finish and detail work on the exterior. Someone from the company called today to inquire if I was satisfied. I am. With Prime Shipping, this is a good value. These have been very helpful for my daughter who is 6 to place onto the keyboard she has while trying to learn the keys.  Highly recommended for beginners. This is some great quality rosin! It melts quickly however, so i would not suggest leaving it in your car (which i have done, unfortunately). To compensate for this, it comes with a nice rubber case that fits inside of the cardboard case so that if it does happen to melt, it will maintain its shape. They\\'re good for the price. Pros: lightweight, easy to assemble, and sturdy. Cons: the speaker plate doesn\\'t lock in place so they rotate fairly easy if you touch them. Also one of the stand\\'s speaker plate is perfectly leveled but I just placed a little felt pad on the base plate and problem solved. I\\'ll probably upgrade sometime in the future but for now these are good! I though I had ordered the PAR46 (that is what I needed) not the PAR 56 and it cost more to return the PAR 56 that I paid for it.<br />The PAR 56 cannot be used and too expensive to return. This instrument holds a tune exceptionally well and the general craftsmanship is excellent.<br />It sounds beautiful. Has been one of the best for the money! great fun A1 The mic itself is great... the issue I have is the customer service and the quality assurance or lack there of.<br /><br />The mic has great lows, limits the breathiness of most mics that don\\'t have the triple cage. However, the mic stand, which should have 3 pads on the bottom only had two. I figured this wouldn\\'t be a big deal, so I contacted Blue and initially the customer service sounded promising. I needed the mic and couldn\\'t go without it, so I requested that a new pad be sent. I sent them photos that it was missing a pad and had zero adhesive residue meaning it was never on. The customer service person made it sound like they could send one out. Then I received an email a couple days later stating I had to send the whole thing back. I responded to that email of asking why and I haven\\'t heard anything back from them for the past 3 weeks.<br /><br />*Pic* Gotta love the missing pad on the bottom of the stand right next to the sticker &#34;QC Passed&#34;... says something doesn\\'t it.<br /><br />The mic itself is 5 star for price and use, but minus one star for the lack of Quality assurance/quality control on the stand and minus another star for customer service not being able to simply send one adhesive pad to fix their mistake and not responding to emails for weeks on end. plugged in this guitar sounds really good for the price.  not plugged in, it\\'s probably 2.5-3 stars (not so good). But then again, it is an entry level Martin, so my expectations were not set super high.  I lowered the action to get easier play, which i suggest doing.  nice size for a travel guitar. An amazing go to pedal for low wattage amps and then some.<br /><br />This is my staple &#34;Always on&#34; pedal when running my Fender Champ 600/Vox Ac4/Vox Night Train or other small wattage non reverb amp.  Turning the soul food side to low gain cleaner sound, increases harmonic response without over coloring the sound while allowing the guitar volume to have great control of the tone.  3 pedals in the loop, a Pork Loin, JRC4558D pedal and then a delay.  With a flip of the switch everything can get tossed upside down with the reverb first -&#62; effects loop -&#62; soul food as the post gain.<br /><br />Please do yourself a favor and sit down with this to get it dialed in.  Decent sounding gain, but gets a tad grainy when dimed.<br /><br />Pros:  Good tone, easy to operate, controls pretty straight forward.  Effects loop and order of effects switch can do unusual things, mess around with this before playing live and changing it up.  One of the best reverb replacement pedals I have ever heard.  Good pedal to be PAIRED with other overdrives.<br /><br />Cons: Does not play well with solid state amps or modeling effects.  Does not actually contain turnip greens and has no nutritional value what so ever. I bought the 211A because I have very small hands, and my hands start aching after a while when I play a normal tenor (wooden or plastic) with wider reaches and keys for the low C and C#. I also dislike the clicking sound those keys tend to make on a plastic tenor. Since I have many other excellent Aulos instruments, including their plastic imitation Grenser Baroque flute, I had high expectations for this one.<br /><br />I have to say that I was disappointed. It is certainly easy to play, but its tone quality is not even remotely comparable to the tone quality of the Yamaha 300 series plastic tenor recorder which I play most of the time. I would still have given it a four-star rating except for one thing: it has no high C# ! That\\'s right, the second to top note in the standard range of the instrument is simply missing. The standard fingering doesn\\'t work for it, and the fingering chart from Aulos which came with the instrument omits this pitch. I tried other fingerings, and nothing worked. I did find a fingering online which involves stopping the end of the instrument with one\\'s knee (one can get an entire extra octave above the standard range using fingerings like that), but I have never considered this practical for normal performing.<br /><br />D major is a fairly common key in early music (many of the early flutes had D as their lowest pitch instead of C), so the fact that the high C# is missing is a serious problem for anyone interested in playing Renaissance and Baroque pieces. Taking that together with the unimpressive tone color, I think this instrument rates only three stars. If the high C# isn\\'t important to you, take my rating as a four star rating instead. Definitely happy with this purchasr. Price was right too. Great headphones for making music or just chilling Great mic, crisp clear vocals! Can\\'t beat the price point Product was received for free in exchange of my honest opinion. This product eliminates external noise and precisely picks up the vibration. It is easy to open, it will clamp firmly to the instrument and protects your instrument from any scratches or damage. fits/works for UMA25S good sound and they hold up longer After spending a fair amount of money getting my guitars set up, I decided I was going to get a basic set of guitar tools and learn to do it myself.  All I really needed at the moment was a way to measure string action, I wont be doing any fret or nut work at the moment, and there are other tools that are perhaps similar, but as soon as I opened the package up I knew I had made a good choice, this thing oozes precise and is very well constructed.  It\\'s super easy to get a precise bead on your string action. It\\'s nice to know that this tool will be there if I ever take my guitar repairing to the next level and get to use some of the other features of this great little tool. I wish I could tell you about the quality of this string, but I can\\'t.  It comes with an adapter to connect it up to a fine tuning peg, but this doesn\\'t fit the one on my violin.  I wish something had told me it wasn\\'t a universal adapter. These picks were okay. They were too flexible though. I could very easily rip them in half. (What can you expect for $1.89 though?) While they are really cheap and you get twenty, they are not worth it. Save yourself time and money and buy one good pick. It really works if you use instruments and amplifiers your life will get better if you use these arrived on time and item was as advertised.  reasonable price and quality product.  great job!! Tips over easily and is not really strong to hold the binders we use for gigs and practice. Pretty much the same quality as those costing much less to my experience. I\\'m a petite lady and didn\\'t have much luck with leather straps that have pre-drilled holes. I found this and it works PERFECTLY with my uke. Completely adjustable to my small frame, fits comfortably and goes unnoticed when playing. Quick delivery, exactly what I needed. Needed to buy several other accessories to get these lights up and running. Once they were up they are fantastic!! This is just what everyone needs.  it\\'s not the fullest version of this software but it has everything you need to lay down some good tracks without waking the neighbors or messing with mic placement.  Blows any cab simulator out of the water. Works like it states. So much better than the cloth and string. I love it. It came in excellent condition.  Thank you.  Peace. ok  for  the  price Good price for my favorite sticks. I have a 3-piece blues rock band that plays clubs, outdoor events and the like to crowds of up to 350. Before buying the SW118V woofer, we played these gigs with a Yamaha EMX512SC powered mixer plus 2 Yamaha 15 cabs on sticks. Adding the SW118V has improved our sound immeasurably. We run mono with the mains driving the 2 15s and the monitor send driving the SW118. We mic everything now (which we couldn\\'t do before), including guitar, kick/snare and bass. Kick and bass go primarily in the monitor send to the 118; guitar and vocals into the main send to the 2 15s. It smooths out the sound remarkably, making even outdoor gigs sound like a bona fide full-production mix. The difference really is remarkable. I can\\'t give this speaker -- especially in a configuration like ours -- high enough praise. It doesn\\'t feel as soft/comfortable as I thought it would be but it\\'s not bad or thing. It\\'s alright. PERFECT Just as advertised, sturdy and easily customized. I am using it for two hand held mikes. No matter what price range, Yamaha seems to maintain excellent manufacturing standards to ensure well-built instruments.<br /><br />Now, this is the low end of their price range, so they certainly use lower grade materials to keep the price down, but Yamaha still manages to make the instrument look &#34;nice&#34;, i.e. paint the backside and neck matte black to cover the not-so-pretty wood used.<br /><br />Does it look fantastic? No. There\\'s little bumps and divots on the neck if you look really close, but the instrument still is very presentable. The spruce top looks nice.<br /><br />Sound: okay, so there\\'s some complaints about the APXT2 not having a full sound, especially in the lower range. Well no kidding, folks. It\\'s a 3/4 guitar, though the body is even smaller than other brands\\' 3/4 guitars. Think Jethro Tull\\'s &#34;Thick As A Brick&#34; guitar opening; the small-body Martin Ian Anderson uses is what this guitar\\'s sound reminds me of---which I like! It has its purpose.<br /><br />Plugging it in: I do not have an acoustic amp, so I will refrain from giving much assessment here, but I did plug it into my Peavey Classic 30 tube amp and there was no buzz or anything like that. My guess is it would be just fine with the proper amplification.<br /><br />Pros: good sound, very playable, aesthetically pleasing, on-board tuner works well.<br /><br />Cons: tuning machines are sloppy, which is probably the cause of it slipping out of tune a bit between playing sessions<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this guitar for anyone looking for a lighter sound, something to noodle on, travel with, etc. Good for small hands or children too! The main criticism of these couplers seems to be &#34;big feet beware&#34;.  Well...I have size 14 feet and have no issue individually turning on several mxr sized pedals.  My board is only one row of pedals though, so I can\\'t speak for owners of larger boards. Bought this as a spur of the moment to get free shipping. Had everything as advertised. I dont know how to play, just wanted to have a guitar in case I ever got around to figuring it out. Learned a few chords, seemed to work well enough for the extremely low price. Nice enough Good picks It\\'s was coming apart These are great the sound is crisp and clean at all volumes. You can hear the highs and mids really well and the bass is exceptional. I would recommend these for a home studio setup easily. They exceeded all of my expectations for the price. I would have paid alot more for speakers of this quality. Cry a little more.... oh you didn\\'t get it on time for a drum event! Truly drumming is about sound. Looking cool is always a part of being a musician but I bought this to endorse the best sounding cymbals on the market! I support zildjian products wherever I go...get over it. Thiers way more to worry about if being a drummer is priority #1. Preformence should be what matters!-zach Very nice case! lightweight clean I am just getting back into collecting vinyl and needed a good entry level turntable. I ordered this based on reviews and I have not been disappointed! There aren\\'t any bells and whistles but I just wanted something that sounds decent that wasn\\'t going to break the bank. I ordered a cork pad to replace the felt pad that came with it because the felt does not lay flat. Other than that I have to complaints. If you are a serious audiophile then stay away from this, I\\'m sure you would be disappointed, but if you are a serious audiophile then I\\'m sure wouldn\\'t be looking at a $100 turntable. It is a  wonderful headphone with good price! The sound of this instrument surprised me. I\\'ve been playing the shakuhachi for 4 years and was astonish by how it sounds for the price. It is a bit thinner than professional shakuhachi and sound exactly like a concert grade shakuhachi, very impressed.  I will purchase more later in the future. the kinko is well made in there. Nice, sturdy case. Fits my son\\'s guitar well and has room to tuck supplies away. Only complaint is that the &#34;lock&#34; doesn\\'t seem to do much, although as I\\'m thinking about it, maybe the key has to keep spinning after it latches before you can remove it? Not sure as my son took the case to college so I can\\'t fiddle with it. Seems well-made, but the neoprene material is much thinner than I expected (seems to be about 2 mm thick) so I don\\'t think it would protect the mouthpiece very well if dropped on to a hard surface.  If you just need something to keep your mouthpiece from rattling around inside your trumpet case, this pouch may work for you.  Doesn\\'t really meet my needs or expectations, though, so I will probably be returning it.  Thank goodness Amazon makes returns so easy. Do its job Works just as needed! Paint chipped quickly frustrating and hard to use, 128 pages in the manual and I can\\'t get my head around this, selling it Bought these for my karaoke party.  The guests loved them.  My only complaint was it muffled some of the singing as they were very thick. Amazing tone options.  Awesome for recording as well as gigs.  Love the weight. nice My favorite strings! Great tone! I play an Ibanez AFJ85 hollowbody, the D\\'Addario Jazz Light Chromes have a warm mellow tone which is great since my guitar is naturally bright being a hollowbody. The texture of the flat wounds are smooth and easy on the fingers, perfect for rhythm and lead, especially if you play fast. These are the longest lasting strings I\\'ve played, I change them out about every 2-3 months and I play my guitar almost daily. Im a worship leader at church, the strings sound great playing live on stage. My main style of playing is a mix of rockabilly and old school punk, but they\\'re also perfect for jazz and blues. I first learned about these strings when I bought my guitar a few years ago, they came stock. Been using the D\\'Addario Jazz Light Chromes ever since! I have heard of people using them on solid bodies but I have not tried flat wounds on my solid body guitars. But I do recommend them on hollowbodies. Received it in mail where it was waded and wrinkled. Item exactly as advertised. My son loved it! These are fantastic little boxes, great for corporate A/V work WOW !!!!!!! Just takes me back to when i was a Kid ! I Hope some of the professional dj lighting companies can bring this back also. THANK YOU STARLIGHT.COM AND AMAZON.COM !!!!!!!!!!!! Works wonders on my 12 string guitar. It makes it look unique just so I can show it off to my friends. Don\\'t hesitate buying this product if you\\'re interested. well....i got mine for a a whole lot less than this price so that is one reason i love mine....it was a demo model....in original box for almost 1/2 this price.....i would not pay the current  price for one.....the reverb on this amp is not good, at all, trust me, it is awful....if you dont use reverb, then you will not care.......i use my Boss Fender REverb pedal, which sounds really great ....i use a MArshall Compressor and whatever kind of overdrive pedal.....this amp will get super loud with a lot of bottom....i use a Telecaster with duncan stack pickups....i can dial in a huge fat bottom heavy jazz tone.....really it is amazing...for solo playing..you could do any solo jazz gig with this amp and those pedals.......any rock or country gig......the amp is very light..no buzz or vibrations, so far. easy to pickup and carry, that\\'s why i bought it....i can\\'t lift an AC-15 or AC-30 and the AC-4 is too under-powered for my needs....the 10&#34; speaker in this amp needs a good breaking in...it sounds like ass for a while then it loosens up good....it is physically impossible to install any other 10&#34; speaker due to the amp\\'s weird design....trust me...i tried...nothing else any good will fit....i did replace the 2 12ax7 tubes with some new EH models....improved the sound....so far i just left the original EL84\\'s alone, but may someday spring for a good pair....mostly this amp needs to be played hard for a good week or two to deliver a good sound....i guess you could gig with it with just a guitar and a chord , if you just sorta strum and sing..it might be just fine for that, its got the volume for it....good for a Beatle act...you can make it overdrive just by adjusting the gain and volume  knobs., but it wont sound anywhere as good as a good quality overdrive pedal.....it has the Vox high end sound but you can also make it sound sorta like a Fender, by turning the knobs....its versatile, good sounding , loud and light...to me, it just needs  a good front end boost from a pedal or two to start a happening sound.......the price seems to have gone way up since it was first released, i dont know why that is...... you might still find it worth the price but if you start trying to change tubes you will be adding maybe 75 more dollars , making it a 500 dollar amp..it sounds way way better than ANY OF THE VOX MODELING AMPS..it sound real.....i would not recommend wasting any money on those  modeling amps if you are going to gig..but for home use , they are your own business.....from a pedal or two to start a happening sound.......the price seems to have gone way up since it was first released, i dont know why that is...... you might still find it worth the price but if you start trying to change tubes you will be adding maybe 75 more dollars , making it a 500 dollar amp..it sounds way way better than ANY OF THE VOX MODELING AMPS..it sound real.....i would not recommend wasting any money on those  modeling amps if you are going to gig..but for home use , they are your own business..... All the reviews that say there is a cracking sound when you use your ipod or anything plugged into the AUX port are correct. I tried several different cords and devices and they gave the same results. I bought this for my daughter\\'s birthday and by that time the return window had lapsed. Unfortunately I cannot return now. I would if I was able to. Right out of the box, beautiful and plays and sounds better than others costing 3 to four times more.<br />Highly recommend. Love these headphones. Searched Amazon for a whole trying to find a well reviewed pair of Bluetooth earbuds in my budget and these are excellent. Good sound quality and connect very easily.<br /><br />Also, I misplaced the ear hook for one earbud and customer service replied immediately and was very wiling to help. Great product. Last weekend we had a family reunion to celebrate my dad\\'s 60th birthday. He had as much fun with Singtrix as my 5 year old! It was awesome to watch them together. I don\\'t usually write product reviews but I felt like this product delivered exactly what it promised - a great party! It works A+++ Very nice strap.  It was exactly what I expected.  Comfortable and inexpensive.  It is a cradle strap with no option to convert to a hook strap.  Good and reliable but nothing fancy, and it does its job. Sound is goodï¼Œbut logo not same as picture. The item was delivered on time and was just what I needed. As a college student with a relatively small apartment with close neighbors, this product is a godsend. It produces quite a warm sound for such a small and well priced amplifier, and it even has a headphone jack which allows me to play very late at night without disturbing a soul. It is the perfect size for storage in a drawer or cabinet, and even comes with a small battery which you can use to play if you find yourself without an outlet or power. I have had this amp about 3 months now and it seems to be holding up very well with no degradation in sound quality, even though I have knocked it off my desk onto hardwood flooring at least 5 or 6 times which is really telling of the build quality! I would highly recommend this product to someone looking for a smaller amp or just someone looking for some great bang for your buck! Used them for my removable subwoofer box in my car.  The wires are held in securely, and the plugs make a solid connection to the subwoofer.  The connected dual-plug design prevents the two leads from accidentally touching and causing a short or damage to electrical components.  Very happy overall. great! great! great! It\\'s expensive. But since the time I used to have my guitar and bass strap made exactly to my size, I have not used, seen or try a better strap. AWSOME  AND BEAT EBAY PRICE One reed is a little difficult but works fair. This is exactly what I was looking for.  I buy and sell guitars all the time and this will help me in my setups. Great laser show!  I like the colors and the designs it emits.  Looks great with a smoke machine as well! No better case at this price for protecting your Strat or Tele. DJ Coco rocks White Trash Beach with this awesome speaker! It\\'s a sweet looking Bass can\\'t wait to get it so i can make it talk great A+++ Bit overpriced for what it is, but still worth it to those who need an instrument to do what it does. Being \\'open\\' gives it a more midrange tone that cuts through more than a temple block or Jam Block at a lower volume. But, the sweet spot on these Blast Blocks is smaller and requires more finesse to play the way you want. Plays well with all LP\\'s other blocks. If you could only have ONE, I\\'d go for the large green version of this, but the green and yellow complement each other very well, and are both worth it for any serious percussionist, despite the price tag. Excellent product!  Perfect size, weight, and durability for our band\\'s mixer and cords. exactlly what was needed Allowed me to record voice &#34;and&#34; guitar together.  Allows use of computer for recording. I bought one of these and to my surprise , the neck is not painted in vintage style described in the announcement. I was quite disappointed. The sound was as expected, wonderful. In short, the guitar is fantastic , but the announcement made by the seller is misleading. I don\\'t know how Sigler Music hopes to resolve it. I\\'m waiting. fell good This violin not only looks beautiful, it sounds great. I highly recommend them. Excellent value. The quality of the surround sound is excellent.  I am very happy with the quality of the product construction and audio.  I would recommend this unit if you are looking for something small and portable with great sound recording capabilities. I bought these because I needed ultra flexible patch cables for a few of my smaller pedalboards. These are perfect! I typically cut and solder my own cables but the material itself is often quite stiff. These are completely flexible in every way and have, so far, been completely silent (which my largest concern when buying inexpensive cables). A great buy and I would happily purchase more. The charger was dead on arrival.<br />I tested it with a multimeter and yeap, something was wrong with this one, 0V. Bought this for my father-in-law\\'s recording studio. Works great! Well made but too small for orchestra or band folios to fit. Individual sheet music should be fine and small books. Kept it for piano stuff. Would be nice to have a larger option. Stylish option for keeping a sub off of a hard floor.  Helps reduce rattling of objects in the room. Awesome! Junk. Returned them immediately. I use this bench for my very small 5 year old to play the keyboard.  We have been able to adjust it up high enough for him, but his feet don\\'t hit the floor.  We were using a kitchen chair, this is a vast improvement.  He has tipped it over once getting off, but now he is just more careful.  I\\'m sure it would also be a good bench for adults. The only downside is that it\\'s vinyl, and after a while you kind of stick to it.  It\\'s pretty easy to just put a towel down though. I know some people aren\\'t behringer fans but I love this little mixer. I have no issue with this and no feedback in the lines. I love this guy!  It\\'s small and lightweight, well made, and packs easily.  A lot of bang for the buck. I also love that it pulls power from the laptop and doesn\\'t require a power cord.  All in all, a great purchase. Great bundle! I was trying to figure out what the catch was because this bundle is basically the same price as just the headphones. But there is no catch, everything was in the retail packaging and it all worked fine. As for the headphones, they are top notch but I only have one complaint about them; and that is that after a long period of wearing them it will start to hurt above your ear if you wear glasses. But the sound is amazing and the amplifier only makes it better especially if you prefer a little more bass. Clasp broke within weeks of using this item.  Almost dropped my RC controller.  Metal just snapped in half. My first guitar purchase. Seems great. After some adjusting, the guitar sound very good for the price. Excellent / thanks I bought this so I can use this with others who really know how and love to play the piano.  I don\\'t use it myself but the professional players I know use it when they borrow my keyboard and say it is just right. Works good. Not much to say. Just what I needed thank you AAAA+++++ love it It was a birthday gift for my 22 year old Grandson.  He loved it.  The case was very nice, as were all the other extras. Perfec! Great quality and great delivery! GREAT SELLER PRODUCT WORKED GREAT as expected. These work great. All of our guitars are now on the wall and easily accessible. Great case for the money nice uke! stays in tune. I got this capo for free and it was one of the best capo I\\'ve received. It holds your picks as well! It feels very sturdy and strong. Awesome! Exact size and shape for my Twin or Super Reverb... I  like it better then my Fender floor tuner. I can see the notes EADGBE on the box better then the Fender\\'s small letters. has more led tune lights then Fender. seems to be well  made.  Only problem I have is that the D & B are in small letters should be in capitals letters like the rest of the notes. and it has no battery so has to be hooked up to power supply to work, so it\\'s not portable. Other then that it\\'s ( GREAT !! ) I bought this product today. The worst possible. I am pretty tech savvy. No possible way to set this up. But, please go to their website. Here\\'s what you will experience.... Buy this, buy that, buy more. Of course your product doesn\\'t work.... but if you buy more it will. Really we promise. Avoid at all costs. They\\'re not terrible sticks. A little lighter than I\\'d recommend. If you want something a little beefier and more robust I\\'d recommend the fs-pr2 sticks. I purchased the khaki model two months ago (same bag, different color). In that time I have taken it to eight jams and on over thirty gigs and the bag has held up wonderfully. This one is perfect for female drummers (and more than a few show up at jams in my local area). That statement is based on the color. The design is for any drummer, and especially we jazz drummers who do not need a bag full of spare sticks.<br /><br />It holds just enough. The interior is lined, and the pockets are divided into a pair that have clear plastic on the back that is good for sticks, mallets and brushes, and a mesh pair of pockets in front of those for items like drum keys, additional sticks, mallets and brushes, and other small odds and ends. I have mine populated with two pairs of sticks and a pair of mallets in the clear plastic pockets, and a pair of brushes on one side and a drum key on the other in the mesh pockets.<br /><br />A big plus is you can hang this off a floor tom without affecting that drum\\'s resonance. I own some high end, leather bags and while those look cool, they have a noticeable affect on how my floor tom sounds. this one does not.<br /><br />Every seam is nicely stitched and the nylon zipper is smooth. The fabric itself is either synthetic or cloth that has been treated because there is a slight chemical odor when I first opened mine. That goes away after a few hours, and the fabric is water resistant because of either the composition or the treatment (I am not sure which, but I view it as a major plus either way.) There are also reinforcement points that appear to make this a sturdy and long lasting bag. Beautiful combination of bowl and velvet cushion with gold trim<br /><br />It came as described in the Amazon ad<br /><br />Very nice hand-made velvet cushionâ€”an even prettier design than in the photos<br /><br />The gold trim reminds me of scenes of natureâ€”flowers and waves.<br /><br />It is a beautiful little bowl with a beautiful sound, and Iâ€™m glad I bought it The lowest range of Akai Great product well worth the money I spent. I am just learning to play the guitar and this tuner was very easy to use. its great, better than my sony'"

These Really Do Work Great, But You Do Need To Know a Few Things.  I\\'ve Been Using Mine For a Few Years Now.  First, I Paid a Few Dollars Less For Mine and The Price Has Jumped.  They\\'re All Imported, so Try to Find Either a Cheaper One or One That\\'s Extremely Well Made.  This One is Made Well Enough, If You\\'re Careful.  This Thing Can Cut You, So Don\\'t Let Some Kid Use It, &#34;Because It Looks Like Fun!!&#34;  You Need A Pineapple That\\'s Big Enough.  I Can\\'t Tell You How Many Times I Went to Wal-Mart or the Grocery Store and Their Pineapples were Just Too Small of a Diameter.  It HAS to Be Big Enough.  It\\'s Better To Have Some Waste on The Inside Of The Husk.<br /><br />When I\\'m Finished Using The Pineapple Corer, Then I Cut Up the Husk Of The Pineapple To Get The Rest Of The Pineapple Cut Up and I Save The Core of the Pineapple To Go Into My Iced Tea Pitcher or Drink Pitcher (That\\'s How They Do It In Hawaii)  When I Was In Hawaii, They Never Threw Away The Core, They Always Used It For Something.  Sometimes, They Even Grilled It, Although I\\'ve Never Tried That.  But, I Know They Did It With Honey and Some Kind of Teriyaki  People Have Also Left Chunks of Pineapple on the Husk and Grilled it Meat Side Down on the Grill.  Then, They Eat The Chunks of Grilled Pineapple and Use The Husks Like a Little Bowl..  You Don\\'t Grill The Husk Part.  You Can Also Keep The Husk Whole, Like a Bowl and Take the Center Core Out, Then Fill It Full Of Fruit Salad or Use it as a Drink Container or Dessert Container.<br /><br />Someone Told Me They Like To Make Pineapple Greek Yogurt and Fill It, Then Freeze It a Short Time.  I\\'ve Never Tried That.  I\\'ve Made Pineapple Cheesecake and That\\'s Delicious, but I Know It\\'s Tricky Working With Pineapple Sometimes.  You Know, If You\\'ve Ever Tried to Make Jello & Put Pineapple In.  YIKES!!! The Bromelain in the Pineapple Keeps Your Gelatin From Setting.  It is a Great Anti-Inflammatory & Helps Your Digestive Tract & Tummy Feel Better, But That Same Enzyme Interferes with Your Jello Setting Up.<br /><br />When Washing These, Be Extra Carful and Wash Them Separate.  I Use Tooth Picks, to Get the Pineapple Out That Gets Stuck In The Little Crevices.  I Always Put The Parts Back Into The Box & Make Sure Everything is Dry.  So, That\\'s It.  Make Sure Your Pineapple is Big Enough.  Get All Your Pineapple To Work For You.  Clean Your Corer and Protect Your Hands.  That\\'s It.  Thank You For Reading.Same Enzyme Interferes with Your Jello Setting Up.<br /><br />When Washing These, Be Extra Carful and Wash Them Separate.

Absolute favorite for winter. Heavy material. Stretchy, shows shape well. I am 5ft 7, 120 lbs. Ordered 2-8. Fits fine. Not tight at all. But not to loose. Very confortable. I live in ND, and it keeps you warm during winter. If its not cold. You will get hot. I got it just for winter. So its perfect. About to order anothwr in different color.<br />;0) Nice socks, great colors, just enough support for wearing with a good pair of sneakers. I bought this for my husband and WOW, this is a slick hat. High quality and craftsmanship. He said sits very comfortable and he gets compliments constantly! Highly recommend this hat! Perfect dress and the customer service was awesome! Excellent for my 6 feet skinny 15 years old boy. Raw is the only way to go! Absolutely love this wallet! Will continue to buy it forever and ever. A bit large. Great fit! Shirt a bit too long, with heavy hem, which inhibits turning over.  I cut off the bottom two inches all around, and am now somewhat comfortable.  Overall, material is a bit too heavy for my liking. The Jockey Women\\'s Underwear are true to size. They are my choice of underwear. I will purchase them again as I have in the past. cup size is just right.  Seems to be a little tight around.  Might just be because it is new. Perfect... best  ever4 for men&woman too size for men 42-44-8, 40-42 ,7  38-40 ,6  this for guy waist size hold man place nylon 100% best ever over 30yrs love sleep more black gym , slakes, blue jeans  chnage clothes at gym they all ask what kind underwears those, reply hey&#62;&#62; get your own pair! by vanity fair! Great fit. I have this Columbia in 5 colors and wear them all the time My husband found these so comfy that this is our second order. Awesome leggings!! I am 5\\'4, 215lbs and a huge chunk of my weight is in my thighs and butt. Not exaggerating - 30 inch thighs, 52 inch butt, 37 inch waist. These leggings are buttery soft and NOT see through at all, even in sunlight! Now I purchased the \\'glyph idc\\' black and white color so that is the one I am speaking for. I\\'m very impressed & ordering more ASAP. I ordered the same size as I ordered last time, and these shirts were much larger than the previous order. They were also about 6 inches longer. It was like they sent men\\'s shirts instead of boys\\' shirts. I\\'ll be returning these... not exact in sizing Love these pajamas.  Be prepared to be very warm.  These are definitely meant for cold winter weather; besides that they are beautiful! Like the way they fit and feel during the day. Just wish they weren\\'t so expensive. pretty color-these Glamorise bras are amazing-they hold you all day long and the only complaint I can think of is how the bottom band rolls up when you sit down--but this is a universal bra issue, I think. Excellent one from Levi\\'s Love this sweat shirt The neck on this is a bit saggy, but is a nice sweatshirt. Colors are great and fits as expected. Thank you very much, it\\'s very beautiful This is the second tank I have ordered, I wear both of them often. They wash well and I receive many compliments on them! I did not buy this jacket from Amazon. But it is simply the worst jacket I have ever bought. I bought this jacket for my teenage daughter in the same color as above. It is NOT that color in person. And even worse it is not thick and fluffy like it looks. It is literally so thin it was mailed from REI in a mailer the size of a manila envelope. I thought there must be some mistake...... Unfortunately it was no mistake.<br />I really wanted to buy my daughter a nice jacket , one that would last several years. I saved up my money thinking The North Face had a good reputation . How embarrassing to talk up this product and then see the great unveiling of this thin uninsulated little cinch sak.<br />Save your time and  money buying and returning it and see it in person if you are determined to buy this style and brand. Your wallet will thank you. Keep in mind I have never seen the product. I ordered it for my dad as a his birthday gift. He called me to say thank you and just how much he loves the color as he will be able to mix it for a few suites to make a statement. Then he called again to tell me he really like the set. He though it was more of modern feel and look. He almost make me feel like this is the only gift I\\'ve gotten him that he actually likes! Either way, this was a great gift for him. Great fit & love the print. Will probably order again. awesome fit, hot style, i love it I received the RFID Blocking Leather Wallet. The first thing I noticed is the pebbled texture and it\\'s very soft. I love the flip out window which makes showing your identification quick and convenient...don\\'t have to worry about leaving your id behind! Also, the navy blue stripe patterns inside the billfold section is a nice touch. There are 8 credit card slots to pack your plastic! It\\'s a slim design, nothing bulky here. Of course, the RFID protection built into the wallet is the best feature. Nice not to worry about scanning devices or wireless identity theft. I love this wallet. The first thing I noticed is how soft and flexible it is. Most wallets tend to be a bit stiff, even when they are completely empty. This one is flexible enough that it is more comfortable to keep in my pocket than most wallets. The leather itself is soft and has a pebbled texture to it.<br /><br />The wallet is also nice to look at. The lining inside is black and white striped, which I thought was a bit interesting, but it grew on me pretty quickly. The edges of the wallet aren\\'t at all rough and the seams are all well done.<br /><br />This wallet has plenty of room to hold everything I need to put in it. I also really like having two spots for for cash or papers in the back. I like being able to keep my cash separate from anything else and that isn\\'t possible with some wallets. The RFID blocking is a great additional feature that I really appreciate.<br /><br />I love this wallet for myself, but it is also a great wallet for gifting.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I\\'m a size 34B and size B fit perfectly. It is very comfortable and feels like I am wearing practically nothing. I wore it with my club dress and I forgot I was even wearing a bra. These give my tatas enough cleavage. Also it is simple to clean after you have worn it. I will probably buy more for the future!!! it\\'s fine. Super nice comfortable socks..I got all the colors and loved it...<br />Thanks for the great service. Cute dress,  Please be advised that this cute dress runs very, very small in size. You would definitely need to order a couple sizes or even three sizes larger than normal.  I\\'m 5 &#34;3&#34; it is much shorter than I expected. Also very SHEER you would Definitely  have to wear a slip with it.  This would definitely be a cute dress to wear if I could have fit it. Love this tank, fits about 1/2 size smaller so I suggest ordering up a size. Other than that it\\'s a great quality tank top! The pants were great! Just one thing...it wasn\\'t the right color. Apparently grey means khaki but that\\'s none of my business...<br />In all seriousness the fit was great but I would have loved to have gotten the right color. Dress looks great on. The wrap in front hides any tummy bulge so I can eat and not have to suck my stomach in or wear a girdle. Wish it came in more colors. High quality T shirt, quick shipping. This product is a piece of s***. It doesn\\'t look anything at all like the picture. Don\\'t waste your money on something that you will end up regretting and then having to return. This company is horse s***. ITS THE PUERTO RICAN FLAG. Amazing \\x1aThe quality is good.Product arrived on time and as described. Will buy again from seller. The shirt arrived fine, but as soon as I opened it I could tell that it would be more of a dress for me than a shirt(I am 5\\'3&#34;)It hits about mid thigh on me. The shirt itself is large but I will not fault that on the seller since I ordered a little on the large size but it was a lot larger than I expected. Everything else is great though, I love the feel of the shirt, it is very soft. I wanted a different color than black, but that just gives me an excuse to get another shirt. Love love love this shirt ðŸ˜€  fits good and comfy . Thanks for my clear jewelry drawer I am loving this item So comfy! I usually just wear them around the house as I don\\'t think I can pull them off, but they are long enough for me (which is awesome) and SO soft, flowy, and comfy! I\\'d buy more in different colors if I thought I could pull them off outside of the house. Very cute, stretchy. I got the patten shown as the default and have worn them out numerous times. Super comfortable and very cute.  The stretchy fold-over waist allows for adjustments in length, and they fit well on my hips.. it\\'s not a dress but a top. cheap fabric, not linen. nothing that you see on the photo It\\'s a perfect fit and is very comfortable, the item was shipped fast, and I love it! it has great detail and cheap. The dress is cute but the top runs small and the bottom is very long...I\\'m going to cut off the top and make it into a skirt I purchased this in Winter White, and I like it. I like the Henley style neckline. Comfy and cute. Never go wrong with Blair clothing. GREAT FIT FOR CURVY BUILD.  VERY SEXY AND QUALITY FABRIC.  LOVE IT! Excellent warmer. The heat settings are great and the size of this warmer is perfect and portable. I\\'m very happy with it. My son wanted to learn how to play so we got this for him. He is learning and he loves this guitar. Its light enough from.him and as far as I can tell seems to produce a good sound. Eastern Washington University\\'s mascot is the Eagle not the Bulldog.  Whoops! the best Very beautiful organizer! I have fixed it on the wall in my bathroom and it looks so good! I put my nail polish and different body lotions and hair products in it. There is mandy room for different things in it. The shipping was very fast. i love it! love this clever design! Love this denim wash! Iâ€™ve been using it for the past year and my jeans still look new. No longer have issues with fading like with normal detergents. A little goes a long way too, this stuff lasted me nearly a year. Very cheap material and does not fit properly. Extremely see through. Not worth the price That\\'s not the right house, that picture is the kraken of house greyjoy. Super soft and stretchy...great for fall and winter!! Thank you:) Absolutely LOVE this dress!!! Perfect!! I bought a size larger knowing from other reviews it ran small. I\\'m normally a medium and bought a large and it fit perfect!!! Can not say enough about it! no like picture , looks cheap Comfortable wearing.Cheap price, but nice fabric. Here is my wife\\'s review of this product:<br /> I got this off amazon a little skeptical but hopeful. I buy A LOT of makeup and eyeshadow tends to be my weaknes. I  wanted a large range of colors and was hoping these would be really pigmented. I am not disappointed. These shadows are beautiful.  They are really easy to blend and they are super vibrant. I like these just as much as some of my super high end brands. The quality seems pretty good but I can\\'t wear it! I usually wear a L (or size 10) and the XL is way too small for me!<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Runs very small. Need a tiny waist to wear it. Style is adorable, buttons down the front, fully lined. I ordered a large per the size chart, I normally wear an 8. About 4 inches small In the waist. Orange and off white colors are very pretty. Style, cut, and length are great. Sizing is way off.<br />I received his product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. Opinions are my own.<br />I alSo ordered the cotton Heather grey skirt in XL, I normally wear an 8. The XL is perfect. The back zipper works well. The thick waist and and pleats, make it fit well and look cute. Two pockets, falls above the knee. Very cute and comfortable. I sadly didn\\'t get to wear it - it was too small. Too big up top from the straps - too small at the butt. It sucks. I really wanted to try this - but from the feel of fabric it felt like it was made correctly and not cheaply.<br /><br />bought this at discount for my honest review I was really looking forward to the skirt as it looked so nice with the suspenders in the picture, however mine did not come with any suspenders. The skirt also runs small so I was not able to comfortably wear it. Other than the size issue and suspenders, this is a nice skirt. It has a stretchy polyester feel to it and the buttons on the front are sewn securely (they\\'re not going to fall off )<br /><br />I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. the color is nicer than expected!  and i really didnt expect much of the workmanship but i am lucky and the top i received was great!!!  The ink does run, but the material is light enough to wash in the sink in cool water and let drip dry.  Its a little big but its supposed to be swingy so i am very happy with this purchase! Bought this for my wife. The fit is a little baggy but other than that she likes it a lot. I like this shirt. It is light weight and does not cling to much to the skin. Only thing I do not like about it, is it is a more boxy than it is pictured. It works for me, but it may not work for everyone. I received more than one shirt. One is a very nice tee shirt. the material is extremely soft and lightweight and it has a cute little decorative pocket on the front. It seems to be well made and fits really good, it is so comfortable to wear. I love that the material is not to clingy and the shirt is a bit longer than other. I got this in both the grey and the tiffany color which is a turquoise, both are very pretty colors and look like the pictures. I also got the long sleeve grey one with lace back, fits really good and is a little heavier weight material then the tee shirts, the lace back dresses it up a little.<br />Disclaimer I received this item at a discount for my honest review 95% cotton 5% spandex. Make this a form fitting tank top with adjustable and removeable straps. This is a great tank for every wardrobe. It can be worn under tops or dresses with or without straps. It is snug fitting, but to be strapless, it kinda has to be.  Machine wash gentle, tumble dry low. I ordered an XL per the size chart. I normally wear a size 8, 36c bra, this top is tight fitting, but very comfortable.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. Opinions are my own. 5 stars i purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review Cute top!  Fits a little odd across the chest but all in all I like it and the style is very cute!  Nice material not cheap at all. Great quality, I like the colors (more vibrant than pictured) but it fits smaller than expected. I usually wear M/L and the XL fits perfectly on me.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Deez nuts over trump and Hillary<br />Deez nuts rule the land This is racist.  To protest NYPD?  You should be ashamed of yourselves. I ordered this to wear at a Con in Atlanta and was worried it was going to be too hot to wear.  I was expecting the fabric to be thick and stiff.  It\\'s actually very comfortable and breathable.  It\\'s a mix between cotton and linen much like the shirts I wear in the Florida heat so I don\\'t expect to have to worry about heat exhaustion even though it\\'s long sleeved.  I will update after the Con on how well it performs.  The fit is a bit looser than I expected but that\\'s actually a good thing in my case.  I have a 48&#34; chest and ordered the X-Large according to the size chart.  I was expecting the shirt to come out a bit small for me as I am very overweight and my gut definitely exceeds my chest size.  The shirt is actually a little loose on me.  The sleeves were too long for me but that\\'s normal for me.  When you have to order larger sizes because you are overweight, the arm length increases as well.  If you have this same problem, you can re-sew the button for the cuff to make the cuff size smaller.  That will make the cuff stop when it touches the top of your hand instead of hanging down over your hand.  I almost forgot:  They shipped amazingly fast.  I was expecting this to take nearly a week without Prime shipping and was worried it might not arrive before the convention next week.   Amazingly, it arrived at the same time as the Amazon Prime items I ordered along with it. Design stolen from Olipop!!! DON\\'T BUY!!! Exactly as ecpected. Its a great hoop and was easy to mount and install. Well made too This dress is Amazing. I love it, comfy and sexy. beautiful dress!! must get in another color I bought this to help organize all my kids play hats. They dress up a lot and their costume trunk is really full. It rates so it makes it easy to access what ever hat they are wanting. It\\'s well made and easily put together Nice dress coat. Not exactly as shown, but it looks and fits good. Has white insert instead of white piping shown. This is lovely especially for a nice family bike ride and it has a great speed safe for the children\\'s ride this on family trips and hiking trips it rides lovely I purchased this dress to wear to a wedding. I am 5\\'2&#34; and about 150 lbs, I am curvy with an hourglass shape. The style of the dress accentuates my good areas will minimizing focus on my bad areas. However, since I am a bit on the short side, the dress falls a bit longer than I would have wanted. It is past my knees. I purchased the purple. Must buy I use this everyday it helps to keep dirty clothes and clean clothes organized also it\\'s easy to move if h would like to fold it up if you are moving So much to say I love this thing it is perfect anyone who has a lot of clothes and less storage knows what I\\'m talking about you must buy this This is really great if u have any muscles to work out. Specifically athletes this works great for those little spasms u tend to get it helps increase our speed I love it different, fun and comfortable, perfect for the back I really love this chair very comfortable and easy to put away. very comfortable, soft and easy to install, I love to sleep on it I am a US size 16/18. A 2x fit great! I can wear it low or high on my waist! I am 5\\'2&#34; and it hit slightly above my ankles. Definitely going to buy in more colors! The liner wasn\\'t transparent for me either. Really Nice socks,good quality,good price..Recommended In general I am very skeptical about purchasing sports products online, I prefer buying  things after trying or seeing in person. Looking at the picture I loved the color options and seemed pretty well made. I must admit the texture and the color are even better than the picture. Great product, amazing quality, best running socks ever!!! Highly recommend this product. Is this for two year old burlesque? This is something that doesn\\'t need to exist. Also, I think that the definition of &#34;cami&#34; needs to be looked up again.  No thanks on this product. This shirt is amazing, I got a ton of compliments the first night that I wore it. Very comfortable and light. Fits a little big which is great for working out.<br /><br />I recieved this item in exchange for an honest review. Deez shirt is the best! I like deez nuts...on my t shirt Perfect to make a 10 yr old to smile after the devistating loss of her only big brother last week. Light weight t-shirt, good fit after workout & casual wear. Soft feel & touch. Good Quality<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0146UZMP2 Basics Men\\'s Single Jeysey Weave Halfsleeves Casual Stripes TShirt]] Perfect blazer . It fits just right and good quality. fabulous, fits all my makeup is very practical and easy to carry The best travel case I have ever owned! It is so spacious yet doesn\\'t take up much room for travel, I love the compartments and how easily accessable everything is to get to. It looks tidy and sleek at the same time, I definitely recommend :) This is my new favorite body shaper! I\\'ve tried all sorts of these waist cinchers and shapers recently, and I can honestly tell you that I was a little leery about accepting one more free sample. But, when I was offered the chance to review this one, I knew I had to try it for one main reason -- the zipper! All the rest of the ones I\\'ve tried have been hook and eye or tie up, and those were tedious to get in and out of. Some have ribs that dug into my skin, and although most made me look great, they were often uncomfortable and I had difficulty sitting and bending in them. Not this one! Made of a nice stretchy material, it also has a very soft interior, and I got mine in the beige color. As far as size, I ordered the XXL even though it was a little bigger than I need according to the handy chart on the product page.<br /><br />What I really love about this body shaper -- it\\'s smooth, and one piece, with a hook and eye closure at the bottom in the crotch area so it fits quite tight and everything gets compressed evenly. It is advertised to take 2 to 4 inches off your waist, and it really does. Because of the zipper, there are no little bulges when worn under clothing. I also like the fact that it has shoulder straps that lift your bust and also compress it a bit from both sides, evenly, to really enhance the look and even defy a bit of gravity! So put on your sexiest bra, zip yourself into this well tailored body shaper, and put on your favorite outfit to look slimmer -- and feel comfortable while looking fabulous.<br /><br />I\\'d recommend this most enthusiastically and definitely prefer it to the waist corsets and shapers. Try it, you\\'ll see! I love this. Perfect hoodie Comfortable soft wearing and fits super! It was great I love it so much! You can put it on any side you want ( there\\'s no tag saying it\\'s the back) which I like & the skirt is really stretchable. It\\'s a great skirt to purchase Came quickly was a fantastic product was exactly what i needed it for loved the color [[ASIN:B01462S26G FeelinGirl Women\\'s Adjustable Waist Trimmer Belt Stomach Body Wrap & Back Lumbar Support -Trim Curves, Strengthen Tummy Abs, Improve Posture, Belly Fat Burning Size XL Beige]] I love love love!!!!!! This was just exactly what I was looking for and it shipped to me in less than a week! Its small, but still fits. I usually wear a medium-large. I got a large to be safe, and it fits a tad tighter than I expected. But its cute!<br /><br />I received this item at a discount for my honest review. I ordered the natural color, it is sheer. It is small I went by the size chart, ordered a large. It\\'s a cute style, but won\\'t keep you very warm. Very lightweight, too see through for me. Shorter than the picture. Has a tie waist, with two pockets.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. Opinions are my own.<br /><br />I also purchased the thick and thin women\\'s tunic sweater, in XL,  I went up a size. I love it. The size is perfect. The 3/4 length sleeves sit perfectly. The length of the tunic reaches about 2 inches above the knee. You will need to wear a tank underneath due to the open weaves. The cream color, is a little on the taupe side, with flecks of pinkish orange. It fits very well and looks good. Great fit, nice fabric highly recommend this suit. After seeing the only suit buried in my closet that I never wear, my girlfriend said to me, â€œWeâ€™re going to my parentsâ€™ 30th wedding anniversary party, not their funeral or a job interview.â€\\x9d So I asked her to find me a new one, something inexpensive, because Iâ€™ll only wear it once.  She said she ordered a charcoal grey one by Alain Dupetit, which weâ€™d never heard of before.  The package arrived promptly, but I didnâ€™t bother to take the suit out until the day of the party. Much to my surprise, the suit was in excellent form right out of the box and was ready to be worn without ironing, and the fabric felt nice to the touch. My girlfriend also commented on how nicely it fit me, as if it were tailored.  When my girlfriend and I arrived at the party, her parents told me I looked â€œreally handsomeâ€\\x9d (something this critical duo had never said to me before). But thatâ€™s not just it. Later when I was getting food at the buffet a womanâ€”someone way out of my leagueâ€”came up to me, asked me for my name and wanted to see if I wanted to get out of the party with her and go swimming in the hotel pool. WTF?! Mind you, this kind of thing NEVER happens to me. Iâ€™m not fugly, but Iâ€™m no Christian Grey. At first I thought I misunderstood her heavily accented English, but then she repeated it again slowly, enunciating each word. Before I could get out of my shock and say anything, my girlfriend came over and introduced me to that attractive woman (her motherâ€™s distant cousinâ€™s daughter visiting from France). That experience made me truly understand the phrase â€œclothes make the manâ€\\x9d and realize you donâ€™t have to spend a fortune to look like a million bucks.  I\\'m definitely going to order more suits from this brand. amazing suit! and canâ€™t believe how cheap it costs. as good as any TR suit Iâ€™ve seen. will for sure buy more from Alain Dupetit. thanks for making this item! I am super careful when ordering clothes online and make sure that I check the sizing chart a couple of times before making my selection.<br /><br />When this dress arrived, my daughter was excited to put it right on. Sadly, it was bigger than expected in the arm openings and shorter in the length. However, she likes the dress and that is half the battle with teens. So she is going to wear it with leggings which takes care of the length issue. For the arm openings, she will wear a dark tank while it is still warm outside and then a light sweater once the temps start to fall.<br /><br />Other than the sizing difference, we both like the dress. The top is form fitting while the skirt is free flowing. It &#34;swishes&#34; as she walks which is apparently a good thing to teen girls. Go figure!<br /><br />I left our rating as a 5 since the dress is well made and is super cute. The sizing issue was one we were able to work around.<br /><br />Promotional or discounted product provided for review. This dress is really nice and great quality. However I usually wear a medium/large and I ordered a large and its still too small. I am a size 34B and have a  27&#34; waist and about 38&#34; hips. I got the size small because the size up seemed too big to be form fitting otherwise. Boy, was that a mistake. While the top barely fit, almost too small, the bottom of the dress was like trying to squeeze into a bodycon dress that doesn\\'t have any stretch. Considering how tight the bottom of the dress was, I probably needed a large. However, considering the top, I probably needed a medium. I was highly disappointed since the photo doesn\\'t depict the bottom of the dress being tight at all. It\\'s supposed to be loose and flowy and not like a bodycon dress? Otherwise, the material of the dress itself seemed pretty nice, but I haven\\'t washed it, or even plan to. I got this dress at a promotional price in exchange for a review, but it seems I\\'m going to return the dress because it\\'s not even worth keeping at that discount sadly. (Disclaimer:I received this product in return for an honest review)<br /><br />I LOVED it! I have to admit I got even more than I was expecting the fabric was super comfy and and soft although it was a bit darker in the picture but still looks gorgeous. Shipping was fast I received it earlier than expected. I am very happy overall HOWEVER the only thing that kept me from giving it full 5 stars was that it was missing a button but it\\'s no big deal considering it doesn\\'t button all the way on me so either way i probably wouldn\\'t have used that button which leads me to the next thing which is that although it did have a pretty good fit overall it did seem a bit smaller around the chest on me and couldn\\'t get it buttoned all the way but I understand that is NOT The dress\\' fault as I do have a bigger chest I have this problem with most dresses or shirts I buy anyway but I just wanted to put that out there so my fellow busty ladies could take that into consideration when buying it but all in all I am very happy and will definitely be wearing this many many times!!! Super cute summer dress! Nice and light. Can be worn with a top under it or just plain. Love the fit and style, way cuter in person!<br /><br />* I received this item at a discount for my unbiased review. Love the dress looks exactly like the picture. It fit me a tad bit small, but I am determined to loose some weight so I can wear it out. The dress arrived 3days after I order it. It was sealed in a plastic. I really check the threads and the hem if it\\'s neatly and nicely done, and it is which is good. The fabric is thick, not some kind of cheap thin fabric which is also why I gave it a five star. I just had a tiny problem, since I wear 32A bra 118lbs and 5\\'2 I should have ordered the extra small. The bust size of the small size is kinda big for me. I\\'m really flat chested. So I have to wear this cute dress with bra that has padding. But all in all two thumbs up.<br />Disclaimer:I got this item for a discounted price in return of honest and unbiased review. Love the dress fits amazing and is made with great soft material. The size chart was true to size on me. &#34;I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review&#34;. Chris M. I wore this dress for a party today and got complimented on it quite a bit! It\\'s very light and flowy and I was able to wear shorts under it incase the wind picked it up... But since it was flowy and loose, you couldn\\'t tell I was wearing shorts underneath. It was really comfortable! The back seemed a bit loose and I kept on having to check to make sure my bra wasn\\'t exposed. This a great casual dress for going out on a warm day to pair with sandals or sneakers and a denim jacket. But I can also see this dressed up with a chunky belt and some cute strappy/wedge heels for a date night outfit! Great quality and style. Unfortunately it is too small for a curvy woman and I will have to return. As described by seller. I received a discount for reviewing this product. Great quality shirt. Not thin or see through. Sizing is good. I ordered an X-large for my husband. Looks just like the picture on the product listing. I received this product at a deep discount in return for my honest review. I ordered a size Small and it fit me perfectly. I am 5\\'2&#34; and 115 lbs (female). Shirt quality is very nice. Thick and not see through or anything. Love the shirt. I received this product at a deep discount in return for my honest review. I bought the kangaroo pajamas for my girlfriend (4\\'11\\'\\') in the small size and it\\'s a little large but she prefers them that way because it\\'s a lot more cozy. They are SUPER adorable as well as really good quality. The fabric is very soft and feels very premium. I liked the kangaroo version because it has a pocket in the front where you can not only put the adorable joey (that is included) but other things for easy access. I do wish that the joey had some velcro or something to help keep it attached (it keeps flopping over) but it\\'s an easy fix. It also has two side pockets that are deeper and more secure. I have also tried them on (5\\'6&#34;) and they fit pretty well. The legs are a little short, but based on the pictures I am under the impression that it isn\\'t intended to fit all the way down, but if you want it to order a size up! In an update I\\'ll add pictures to give a better idea of the fit.<br /><br />Update: I\\'ve attached some pictures. Even though they are a little big, it\\'s not awkwardly big and I think it fits better on average sized adults.<br /><br />I received these at a discount for an honest review and I am totally going to order another one for me! This is fantastic. Fit great and fabric is super soft. Had buttons down the front and the head piece sits a bit too low. But super cute on.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount for my unbiased review this is beautiful. my sister wears it in public and gets lots of compliments. it seems to be well made. its easy to put on. she did say it gets warm easily. she is 5\\'7&#34; and it is a little short on her calves but its not a big deal. She loves it.<br /><br />I received this at a discount for my honest review Spectacular model! Love thsee jammies! Good grief this is adorable. This is about the Cow PJs.<br />It\\'s well made, thick, soft fleece that is extremely roomy. Definitely winter PJs (Or at least definitely Texas Winter PJs.) The legs are a little short, but it might just be that the torso is a little long. Either way it looks really cute on. It IS wide. I bought a small and my xl self could probably fit in it... Do NOT order up like you would with most PJs. I imagine they got around the skin tight PJ rule by calling it cosplay. I\\'m not sure I\\'d order down either just because it looks really cute big.<br /><br />It has buttons down the front, and no butt flap, but a really cute tail. My daughter has a new favorite pair of PJs.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion. Cool Tshirt. Great colors great fit ! My son loves it My kids love it !! Nice fit!! Love it very comfortable Great shirt like it! Great fit super cute Great material Great fit very comfortable.. My son loved it ! Thanks !! Fits great love it !! very warm jacket, always receive compliments on it! I love it! :) Umm this is black Veil brides My aunt is going through treatments right now for the third time. She lives in Florida, so it is often to hot for her to wear a wig all the time. She often goes around with nothing because it is more comfortable. She mentioned that at times it is awkward when people stare. I jumped at the chance to review these items because it is something she can really use!<br /><br />Great soft material that hugs your head! I really like the elastic piece at back to hold longer hair. This allows my aunt to use this later when her hair grows in as well. It is a light weight material, so it should not be too hot in Florida. It is a great way for her to cover her head and not feel so awkward. She can also attach her bangs piece to the front!<br /><br />If she is ok with taking pictures I will ad them, for now you have to settle for photos of me in them.<br /><br />Disclosure - I received this product in exchange for an honest review.

This hammock is perfect for camping & hiking because it is lite weight and compact and comfortable johlibb The perfect hammock for any outdoor area, I love the colour and how sturdy and easy to put up it is! It is easily portable and comes in so many cute colours, I love this piece :) It ties in with all my other outdoor furniture! This bodysuit really does the job! Curves galore and shaping! Geez! I flaunted a bit in the mirror when I got it on. LOL I purchased a 38D and I am a full figured woman who normally wears a large or extra large American sizes. With a little effort I got this body suit on. Once it was on it was comfortable and flattering. I can\\'t imagine wearing this to an all day event as getting in and out of it to use the bathroom would be a hilarious issue. You step into it, and pull it up to get it on. It closes with clasps and a front zipper. The bra straps are adjustable and can be worn different ways to accommodate most dresses, even strapless. Regardless of the bathroom issue this comfy and flattering bodysuit is my new go to shape wear for a night out. Note: I received this discounted item in exchange for an honest review. thanks very cute dress looks luxury for special place thank u!!! great for road trips! I like it for my Saturn lw300 wagon works great in the back.  By johlibb Sometimes, I feel self conscious. I\\'ve lost 140+lbs, and kept it off for the past 5 years.Even though I\\'m considerably thinner. and do love my body, I was left with a bit of loose skin around my abdomen. For the most part, it\\'s easily concealed.<br />There are times I want to wear more form fitting dresses or bodysuits, and don\\'t want lumps & bumps to show.<br />That\\'s when I depend on Shape Wear to help. I\\'ve tried tons of brands + styles. I ordered this in hopes of improving my curves, and suppressing the trouble areas.<br />I received the package within a day and a half! Minutes of snagging it from my mailbox, I rushed to my bedroom to try it on.<br />I was blown away by how easy it was to get into. It only took maybe 2 minutes (if that) to completely latch the hooks and zip up. In the past, I\\'ve struggled~this one is super easy to get into. The zipper locks into place, and the silicone around the top, fully holds it up.<br />  The fabric is soft, feels lightweight and easy to breathe and move around in. It Lifts, Tones + Cinches in ALL the Right Areas:<br />*It gave me a much smaller waist<br />*smoothed the area around my bra line<br />*lifted my backside<br /> *toned my thighs<br />and was like an &#34;instant tummy tuck&#34;, without the pain & downtime!!<br />*I probably should\\'ve ordered a size or two smaller. Though. it does fit well, nonetheless. For future reference, this is true to size*<br />I\\'m thoroughly impressed with this longline, high waisted piece. It\\'s study and exceptionally well made. I love the high quality, firm, stretchy \\'control fabric\\' that effortlessly gives the illusion of an hourglass figure.<br />Just putting it on improves my confidence level. Wearing it out? I feel stunning and am pleased with my &#34;new figure&#34;!!<br />I highly recommend giving this a try. It\\'s unusual to find shape wear that is comfy, and still contours.<br />*i received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. thanks very beautiful love the dress LOVE THIS, it is great! Fit absolutely snug and definitely protects perfectly! Adjustable, protect your eyes well and is a good price.!! I was super excited when I opened my amazon box and seen his gorgeous dress. It was so beautiful. I usually wear an XL and they fit perfect, but sadly this one was too small. I could just cry.  I received a discount for my honest review. I was super sad that this dess did not fit me. I usually can wear an XL and im a 13/14 but this XL was made for a 10/12.<br />I received a discount for my honest review. Studded and very pretty. The studs on the shoulder add a nice twist to an otherwise simple dress. I was expecting more of a white dress, but the dress is a light blue/gray. I am happy with the color though. I ordered my regular size and it ran a little big on me. The belt does make it more fitted and seem not so big. I tried a wider black bet of my own with it too and that seemed to make the fit  even better. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my review. I ordered this dress for myself because I currently donâ€™t own a lot of dresses and thought the color and style were beautiful.  When my order arrived and I opened my package, I was amazed how beautiful it really was. The same night I got it in the mail, I went out with my friends and a lot of people commented on my dress.<br />This is perfect for a day out, night out with friends, date, Holiday and special events. I would recommend this product because it is a beautiful but simple dress that can be worn for many different things.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I ordered the &#34;Raglan Flutter Sleeve Women Casual Dress.&#34;<br />I\\'m 5\\'5&#34; with a longer torso vs legs. I followed the pictured size chart (not Amazon\\'s, you\\'ll likely order a dress that\\'s too small if you use their standard size chart here), took my measurements, and the dress fits as expected. This dress sits at my natural waist and the hemline is right around my knees. The material is thin, but opaque (black dress). It is also soft and comfortable. My only quibble is that the material does pick up some lint/pet hair that was not difficult to remove. I received this dress at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.<br /><br />Update: The fit is flattering and I have received many compliments on this dress. This dress appears well-made overall and is very cute.  I actually ordered it for my 10 year old, since we\\'ve been looking for some flowy black dresses for some concept photographer shoots we\\'re planning.  She is 54&#34; tall and 100 pounds.  I attempted to order the Extra Small but it was out of stock and I went with the Small.  I\\'m glad I did, since it fits, but not with a lot of room to spare.  She\\'s a little chunky so I hope as she grows taller, the dress will still fit.  It\\'s difficult to find dresses for little girls who are outgrowing children\\'s sizes (in the bust) but are still not developed enough for juniors\\' sizes.  This dress is conservative enough.  The neckline is a little deep on her but a think black undershirt/tank correct that issue.  The material is very soft, silky and stretchy and ultimately, she loves the dress.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for sharing my honest, unbiased review. I bought the yellow one and I really like it! It looks well-made. The material feels breathable (60% cotton, 40% silk). You\\'ll need to iron it though. I love the V back and the side pockets. It has zipper closure on the back.<br /><br />The size is in between &#34;true to size&#34; and &#34;slightly smaller&#34;. If you\\'re in between sizes, order one size up. However, if you\\'re true to your size, I feel like ordering your true size will be fine. Depends on how you want it to fit. I\\'m a bit fuller on the chest, so I ordered a size up. And it fits nice, I think. The dress is a bit too short for my liking (I\\'m 5\\'4&#34;), but wearing a leggings would solve the problem. Overall, it\\'s a cute dress, and it\\'s something I\\'ll wear a lot.<br /><br />I received a discount on the dress for my honest opinion. My review above is 100% unbiased. Get a size larger. I got the Gold Rings of Rose and it\\'s absolutely beautiful. It kind of reminds me of a Flapper dress from the 20\\'s. In my dress buying experience on Amazon so far, it seems like many sellers are from China. Sometimes it can make getting the right size kind of tricky. They have the size chart on this listing - but I don\\'t believe it\\'s correct. I am 5\\' 5&#34; and about 120 lbs. If I were shopping locally with a US dressmaker, I\\'d usually get a size 4. If I follow the size chart in this listing, that would be a small. But suspecting this might be a dress from China, I ordered the medium. It is a perfect fit. If you are a similar size to me, definitely get a medium. Just thought I\\'d want to mention that, as not everyone will know the sizing issue. What I mean by a perfect fit is it\\'s not tight or restrictive - and yet it doesn\\'t look frumpy or too big. It is about 1&#34; above my knee and is figure flattering.<br /><br />This is a more mature dress. I\\'d say it\\'s for a mature adult woman rather than a teenager. The colors are rich. It has style. This dress is 100% polyester. I love that. I just had my cat jump in my lap and no hairs are sticking. This is one reason I love polyester, that, and it\\'s wrinkle resistant, and you can wash it a million times and it still looks good. It also has a vibrant purple built-in slip under the outer dress - so it\\'s not too sheerâ€‹. This would be a nice dress to wear to church or out to dinner. I received this dress at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review. All opinions expressed are truly my own. Very pretty and would recommend! I wasn\\'t sure what to expect after reading the reviews.  The size chart was pretty ambiguous, so I simply took a chance.  For the price it seemed like a small risk.<br /><br />I ordered the Regular with hesitation since I\\'m usually right between Misses & Plus sizes, right on the crossover.  I thought the slip was sufficiently stretchy and was pleased that I could wear it.  I\\'ve just ordered the Plus size in hopes that the skirt with be slightly longer.  I\\'m pleased to have found an inexpensive resource for slips to wear under crocheted dresses that can be easily altered to accommodate my insulin pump. The hat is incredibly soft and feels as though it will be warm enough for the Canadian winter! For those saying that it does not slouch, you just have to tug it a LITTLE bit and it looks how it\\'s pictured. Shipped internationally very quickly and am overall very impressed with the hat. Cannot wait to wear it, and maybe buy it in a few more colours as well. My son LOVES his new Beatles t-shirt! So do I, wish they had my size too! Fit is normal. Not sure why they advertise it as a girls shirt? Seems like a unisex t-shirt to me! Iâ€™ve been stuck on the same boxers for years. The Eroix intrigued me because of the lack of a stretchy waist band. Iâ€™ve now switched allegiances to Eroix. The only thing better is going commando.<br />The proâ€™s are :<br />1) They just fit at just the right spot on your hips and stay there. Youâ€™re not packing a parachute down every once in a while with the stretch band style.<br />2) Theyâ€™re a little shorter then normal boxers which just feel better. The leg holes give you plenty of room so theyâ€™re still comfortable too.<br />3) The quality on these are great. I didnt know I cared about how well my underwear were made but these make me feel like Iâ€™m wearing something special.<br />4) My wife really digs them.<br />This brings me to the cons;<br />I end up wearing my underwear around the house all the time now since they feel like I have a pair of board shorts on.<br />Pick up a couple of pair to try, you wont be disappointed. After receiving my first order of multiple pairs in both styles a couple month ago, I can say that they are the first pair of underwear I go for after laundry day.<br /><br />I love the button up style and tailored fit of the Boardrooms, but I find there is something unexpected and unique about tieing up my Suit & Tied underwear that I really enjoy. They look awesome and feel great!<br /><br />I like the material because it seems to dry fast and breathe well. I have not traveled to different countries with them yet but I could see how they would be great to have on a backpacking or camping trip. I also feel that the fit on the waist is spot on. I tend to wear a 31 in the waist, and with other brands the sizing can vary. When I put on my Eroixs they fit me perfectly, the sizing is spot on.<br /><br />Itâ€™s nice to have a new alternative to mens underwear.<br /><br />Thanks EROIX! Looking forward to seeing what you all do next. These are like thin board shorts under your clothes. Super comfortable and fit at just the right spot on your waist. Iâ€™m throwing out my Calvin Kleinâ€™s. (I know, Im still stuck in the 80s)<br />For reference, Iâ€™m 5â€™11â€\\x9d and weigh 150 lbs and picked up the 31â€³ waist. The fit is perfect. You also have a little adjustment with the string ties. Casual Chic & Comfortable Underneathwear with an innovative design. Love wearing my Boardroom! A* My boyfriend has the boardroom and I love love love them on him.  They are the perfect lounging underneath wear and work well with any type of jeans especially skinny jeans. Best fitting boxers Iâ€™ve ever owned! Eroix has nailed it with the fit and Iâ€™m surprised how big a difference it makes. Plus I love the throw-back look. Makes me spend more time lounging in my underwear. The underneathwear feels great, I wear a pair of them nearly everyday.<br /><br />I like the simple look of the button up style, and feel of the tailored fit Boardrooms. Most days I will just wear them around the house by themselves and slide on some pants or shorts over them when I go out. They always feel very light and comfortable.<br /><br />Thanks EROIX, Itâ€™s nice to have a new alternative to mens underwear! Guys dont do it. A classic fly front brief old school style like 2xist or Polo Ralph Lauren are the briefs you want. For comfort and room where it counts and a good look on your fit body go with the classics. Whoever designed Y front briefs must have wanted their lion caged up tight with no room to roam. I love the shirt. It fits perfectly. I bought a small and it was loose the way I wanted it to be. Well made if you don\\'t have big boob forget about it! You will look flatter than the sidewalk Item not padded (bra cups) as shown and very thin material. On the positive side, color matches. These are sized like juniors sizing.  Reading the description, I thought that the top might run small, and it did.  I normally wear a 2X, but ordered the 3X, and it is still very form-fitting.  Other than the sizing, and the fact that it\\'s longer than I expected, it\\'s a nice top. First off, this dress came in a lot faster than expected. So that was a pleasant surprise, and props to the seller! :D It was well package so no worries of wear and tear due to travel. I ordered the dress in a small and it fits wonderful. Not too tight, not too big. The material is soft and extremely comfortable as well. The length was also perfect for me as well. I\\'m about 5\\'5, if that helps any.  The color is exact as it is in the picture. There were no loose threads, and appears well sewn. This dress can be worn anywhere. I prefer to wear it with a blue jean jacket and bubble necklace. I\\'m extremely happy with my purchase, and very pleased with the seller in regards to shipping time and packaging. I did receive this dress at discounted price for my honest and unbiased review. I am living in maxi dresses now that I just delivered a few months ago and my body isn\\'t exactly fitting into all of my pre pregnancy clothes.  Nothing is more devastating then putting on my favorite pair of jeans, jumping around the house trying to get them to zip and button up, and they just wont, at least not yet.  I like the femininity of a maxi dress, with the comfort of not squeezing my waist into something and making myself look larger than I really am with a muffin top.  I was a bit nervous with this maxi dress since its horizontal stripes that would make me appear larger than I am.  Regardless, I love maxi dresses and figured I\\'d try it and maybe when I lost more weight I\\'d love it more.  So the dress arrives and like a kid on Christmas morning, I rush to my room to try it on right away, it fit me perfectly.  I have a large bust of 38D/DD, so dresses don\\'t always fit me as I\\'d like them to in the bust area.  the maxi dress is so comfortable and thick unlike many dresses I\\'ve bought that were too tight and so thin that they were almost see through.  The dress is beautiful, soft and casual yet elegant.  Now my only con with this dress is that it comes to my ankles.  I normally like my maxi dresses to fall to my feel but this one doesn\\'t, but I presume that due to my large bust that it possible rides up a bit higher than an average busted woman\\'s dress would.  Now just because its at my ankles doesn\\'t mean its not just as beautiful and elegant, it actually will keep it from ripping at the bottom, and I can also show off some cute sandals with it.  This dress is perfect for spring, summer, or fall pairing it with a cute jean jacket or something for the cooler nights.  I got the Navy and Teal striped dress and the colors are beautiful.  The stitching is done to perfection, with no loose threads.  I love the material of the dress that is 49% polyester, 48% rayon, and 3% spandex. I presume this would shrink in the dryer and since its already a bit short on me, I hand washed mine and hung dried it as the care tag suggested or this can also be dry cleaned.  I love this dress and wore it to my nephews birthday party this past weekend and received many compliments on how beautiful the dress is and how slimming it is on me, exactly what every new mom wants to hear!  Promotional discount provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I am so impressed with this dress.  The material is so soft and has the perfect amount of stretch making it fitted but not stuck to every imperfection!  I am in between a small and medium.  I am 5\\'4 126 lbs and I choose the small.  It is such a great fit and length.  I love the scoop neck line and the racerback back.  You can easily wear a racerback or strapless bra.  The seam down the back of the dress is very flattering on your backside. I will get a ton of use out of this dress.  I plan on wearing it the rest of summer and throwing  a denim  jacket over it in the fall. I did receive this at a promotional discount for my honest unbiased review.  I love it so much I will be purchasing another one. This Racerback Maxi Dress With Stripes is my new favorite dress!<br />It arrived on time and in perfect condition.<br /><br />This dress is amazing for so many reasons:<br /><br />*Trendy- Very in style<br />*Length-Modest yet still stylish<br />*Stripes-Flattering and in a nice neutral tone<br />*The racerback cut- Very flattering, makes your back and arms look nice<br /><br />The material the dress is made out of is SO soft!<br />It is a blend but feels like a nice soft, thick cotton.<br />Very comfortable on, the dress fits nicely, the straps do not fall, or gape.<br />The stitching is all well done, this dress is high quality.<br />Very well made, you can see the craftsmanship is there, up close even.<br />The colors are vibrant and deep, no bleeding lines.<br />Overall a superb fit and cut! This dress is a FIVE STAR product!<br />Keeps me cool in the hot summer and stylish, a win/win!<br />I was lucky enough to receive this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review after being given a promotional discount. I loved this dress!! I had no idea what to expect because you really go in blind when you purchase clothing online. But I was happily surprised! First of all, the colors were beautiful. They were bright and vibrant and really great for summer! Secondly, the fabric was so comfy and soft. The tag says its 49% Polyester, 48% Rayon & 3% Spandex. Itâ€™s also dry clean or hand wash cold. I get very warm in the summer months with the humid temperatures and this dress will be perfect because it really lets the air in and doesnâ€™t make me overly hot like some dresses. I would highly recommend purchasing this dress!!<br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. Looks adorable on my 10 month baby\\'s head, it\\'s so stretchy and have patch on the back of headband, will not leave mark on baby\\'s head. I recommend this item I live sleeveless Picked this one up and \\'Do you even lift bro\\' for my lifting friends who are expecting...it was a big hit! This is very breathable, the only issue I had were the many hooks. It was kind of a pain hooking them all, but it was slightly short on my torso, other than that, this is one of the better waist cinchers, I have tried. It isn\\'t uncomfortable, hot or sweaty.  It really configures your frame, so no fat isn\\'t hanging out over the sides or anything.  I am very pleased with how this looks.<br /><br />sample provided Perfect nice pants, just too small. i am 5\\'9 187 lbs. thighs and butt are a little thick because i work out therefore the pants were small. so i will be getting a different size These shirts are completely awesome. The material is very strong a durable feels like they will last through many of washes. the writing is great. And you can clearly rad what it says. they are very comfortable and everyone else loves them too. I keep getting asked where did you guys get your shirts. people are surprised when we say amazon. these are perfect for me and my hunny bunny. he absolutely loved them and so do I. I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review! All opinions are 100% my own! This is very nice wallet. It\\'s real leather and it feels so soft.  It should wear it nicely and it will look good with age.<br /><br />*  This wallet has many credit card slots and other slots inside to keep money or business card, etc.<br />*  It has zipper compartment and it is large enough to hold for cell phone, keys or coins, etc, so  It can be used as clutch.  It\\'s very useful.<br />*  Also, this wallet is not too heavy and that\\'s another plus!  (it doesn\\'t add much weight to my purse)<br />*  All items stay inside because of button and zipper closure.<br />*  Quality workmanship--All stitching looks good and no lose threads that I saw.<br />*  The zipper is good quality<br />*  Button snaps on/off nice and tight.<br /><br />I received this in exchange for my honest review. I don\\'t rate my review items all 5 stars unless it deserves it. After careful inspection of this wallet, I can\\'t think of anything bad. It really is nice wallet. I love it.  I received camel color. The color is true to what you see in the photos that I attached. here. Lots of credit card pockets Size was not really as expected.  Color was different as well from the picture Really like the fabric, have not washed yet though,but seems of good construction. I think it will run more for 6 month size than three. Cuffs have the extra piece sewn in for mitts if needed.Nice thick, soft fabric that\\'s durable and easy to clean and, most importantly. comfy. I love dressing my twin girls in non-girlie-pastels, so I\\'m crazy about these footies. They are also easy to put on and take off, and run true to size.<br />I did receive this product discounted in exchange for an honest review. Love this dress! So comfortable and I always get compliments every time I wear it. I love this coat! I read many reviews that stated it ran small. The sizing is correct if you do the measurements as indicated. I ordered a Medium as my shoulders are a little broad. Everytime I try to order this in L - when I get to the purchase screen it says XXXL - I want to order but not sure if I will get the wrong size The picture was blue but I guess it\\'s my fault I didn\\'t see that it said black ): other then that they fit good but I\\'m probably going to end up only wearing them to sleep.. Make sure if you buy these you read EVERY detail Ordered a black patterned pair, but recieved black poka dot. Not happy with that, plus the puff balls look and feel very cheap. Perfect This is an extremely comfortable workout bra, the fabric is very stretchy and breathable.  I wear a 34b, and sized up to a large, even though my recommended size is a medium according to their size chart.  I\\'m glad I did, I think it would have been to tight otherwise. The size large is perfection for me. It has shaped, removable pads, and is comfortable to wear (I have been wearing it even on days I don\\'t work out, its REALLY comfortable!! I\\'m wearing it right now). I have (and still use) other sports bras, but this is the most comfortable one I have tried-ever.  I was sent this one free to review, BUT I am ordering the four pack to use daily.  I love it that much! I prefer it to a regular bra because the straps don\\'t dig in or slip off my shoulders, the band doesn\\'t dig in, there are no itchy tags, and it supports my bust without flattening it. Here are the measurements for the size large, laid flat, measured straight across and UNstretched:<br /><br />bottom band: 12.25&#34;<br />top of shoulder strap to hem:  11.5&#34;<br />bottom band stretched: 19&#34; This sports bra fits great and feels so soft. The fit is firm and does an excellent job of holding my team in place. I feel very comfortable wearing this bra.<br /><br />I received this from the seller to try in exchange for an unbiased review. This is a beautiful dress I might get it when I get paid I never thought they would have a titanic dress in my size I ordered this dress and OMG I love it. Fit exactly as I like.  Love it. I will definitely purchase again. This is my new place to shop. Super cute. Fits well, fabric has a stretch to it which I like. The red color is deep and pretty. Love! I love this outfit! I purchased the matching skirt. I love the leather detail on the shoulder and the padding in the shoulder makes it look substantial. The price of this top does not reflect it\\'s high quality - I would have expected to pay more for it. The socks came well before the estimated delivery date, and they look just as good in person as they do in the photos. They are insanely comfortable, and for the price, you\\'d be hard pressed to find a better deal elsewhere. Currently wearing a pair while I get ready to go to work! I will definitely be buying more in the future. Item arrived so fast my head spun! I loved the coat! quality material just not my aesthetic... the bandeau halter is not very forgiving... I would have preferred it to fit a bit tighter/firmer but this material just sort of gathers and cradles your back fat without smoothing, thus putting it on display like a 2nd set of boobs from behind. Also teal is not teal.. suit it more blue than green My daughter though 2 years old wears 3T dresses because of her height, she is half inch short to be 3 feet. She likes to wear dresses more than pants and skirts so I always try to get some varieties for her and no matter what my 1st preference is always cotton or a dress that has a cotton lining. Coming back to this dress, it is made with a cotton lining and a net at the bottom to give it a flare. The dress is made with a chiffon like material with tiny embroidery on it, the belt comes loose with two threads. Overall the dress looks nice when worn but the color of the pink dress that I got is more like peach color. The belt has two threads to keep it in place but my daughter pulled and tore the tread within a day, so I had to stitch the belt to place else I knew it would have lost, the belt gives the dress the nice look it has and loosing would have made the dress lost its prettiness. And one more thing that I would have really like is that if the color of the dress was a little bright, it looks a little dull considering that it is a kids dress. Overall I am satisfied. **I received the dress as a promotional offer to test and use in exchange of my unbiased review. Well my daughter is going to be 2 soon but she has to wear 3T mainly because of her height, generally when she wears the 3T dresses it fits her perfectly and so did this dress. This dress made fully of cotton (except the bow, which is by the way removable) is very beautiful and looks very comfortable. It has a long zipper on the back and a belt too. The beautiful butterfly prints and the cute removable bow makes the dress beautiful and cute when my daughter wore it.  The removable bow/ flower has a safety pin attached on the back so you can decide where you want it, I liked it the way it is shown in the picture. The dress has a nice flare to it and is well made too, no hanging threads, no missing stitches either.  This dress makes a nice summer dress for regular wear. The quality of the cotton is good, not scratchy at all also the cotton is woven tightly so it is not thin material.  Overall highly satisfied and at the price I can buy more for my daughter, as she easily stains her regular wear dresses. The picture shows my daughter wearing the dress and when I told her to stand still so that I can take a picture she lied down on the floor and starting crying..Silly kids.  **I received the dress as a promotional offer in exchange of my unbiased and honest opinion. This is an adorable dress with lots of great details.<br /><br />My daughter is 5 (almost 6), and at 44 lbs, the dress is getting a little small/short on her, but it is adorable and will go to her little sister.<br /><br />The dress has a zipper in the back, and a fabric ribbon at the waist that ties at the back.  I like that the fabric ribbon is sewn securely to the dress in the front half.  If you have ever had to fuss with a ribbon that is not attached (and goes through loops instead), it can be a hassle.<br /><br />The design of the dress is beautiful, and it fits well.  The print is really nice and there are lots of nice details.  The bottom half has a lot of fabric, so it drapes nicely and is very comfortable.<br /><br />It also comes with a flower ribbon pin if you choose to add a little extra flair to the dress.<br /><br />I received this dress in exchange for my honest opinion.  A beautiful dress and very nice to have on hand for special occasions.  Great for the first day of school! great top for festivals! very stylish Perfect gift for my lifting friends that are expecting...they totally dug it! Junk hat. Won\\'t use it. Jeans were good quality & they were &#34;exactly&#34; as shown! My son loved them! True to size as well! Shipment was extremly fast & well packaged! Will shop from this conpany again! Very Pleased! Good range of sizes available. The picture is clear and high resolution. Material is good i am a size 5 in jeans and ordered a small and it fits great only thing is I just had my appendix removed so won\\'t be wearing it until I\\'m fully healed. Can\\'t wait! Fits great Purchased this from the manufacture directly.  Very good quality cardigan. I bought this dress because I loved the design but however I felt like I could use this dress as a top instead because it turns out that this dress is pretty short.I did not need to even modify this dress to make it into a top because while a bit long as a top it looks very nice as just that.I wore it out and was very happy with how breathable and light it was not to mention plyable because it is made from cotton.This dress is not cheaply made,no loose threads and very durable.I highly recommend this dress weather you wear this as a dress or a top it\\'s very pretty on and looks dressed up while being casual.I got this product for purpose of review,all views and claims are 100 percent my own. I ordered a medium per the size chart, I\\'m normally an 8. It is way too small. I can\\'t even get it over my shoulders, and it is tight on the arms. The fabric is very thin and sheer. The only part of the dress that\\'s lined is the top portion. In the model pic, you can see a lining on the bottom portion. It is not there. The dress is very well made. No zippers...one pearl button closure at the base of the neck.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. Opinions are my own. I ordered a medium, I\\'m a size 8 usually...arrived a L....which they explain that the L is a U.S. m I. The sizing chart. Fits great!  It is more of a shiny fabric than I expected. It\\'s hard to tell from the pic, it looked cottony to me. This makes it look dressier, and a little more clingy. The lace sleeve design is very pretty, where the lace is there is no fabric underneath, so your skin shows underneath. I ordered the red color, it is a very pretty shade of red, with a slight orange tinge. I found a few loose threads in the lace and seams. As for length, it is shorter than I imagined. I\\'m 5\\'4&#34;, short.....the hem I. The back comes to the bottom of my bottom. I plan to wear this with leggings. It can be dressed up with heels, and pretty jewelry, or dressed down with leggings or jeans. It is a versatile top. It is very stretchy, and soft against the skin.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. Opinions are my own. Great patch work, was worried it might be done in a cheap manner but was impressed. We could not wait to open this.  I have to say this is the most fun tie I have ever seen in my life!  We turned on the music and turned on and turned out the lights and let it do its thing.  It was so much fun to watch!  I said ok now this is cool.  I did purchase this as a Christmas gift so we had to put it away ;o(  Obviously because it is electronic you can\\'t just toss it in the watch you would spot clean it.  The battery area is easy to get to and easy to replace.  the tie without being lit up is a beautiful color and conceals how awesome it really is.  I highly recommend this tie!  For any fun loving guy in your life or if you are a fun loving guy this NEEDS to be in your arsenal.<br /><br />I did receive a discount in exchange for my honest review.  But this is well worth the retail price.  Id pay it over and over again for this one! Why the hell is the coat not a coat? Everything else about this is amazing quality and 10 out of 10 except THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THERE COULD POSSIBLY BE IN A VERGIL COSPLAY It\\'s a gorgeous shirt, but don\\'t believe the comments that it fits as it\\'s supposed to. An X-Large is more like a Medium. Don\\'t get me wrong - I\\'m a big guy, I admit that. Nonetheless, the measurement guidelines do not apply to these shirts in X-Large, at least. If ordering XL or larger, I\\'d advise going up a size or more. High quality construction, love it! Skeptical, but wanted to try the Spanx bodysuit, & I\\'m glad I did! Lightweight & comfortable, with minor control, this is exactly what I wanted. This was received for free or at a discount for my honest thoughts and review. All thoughts are my own and no other\\'s. This review is in the guidelines of the FTC.<br /><br />This shirt is not just an election shirt, it\\'s a piece of history, a Novelty.  Anything that can be a piece of history, I\\'m interested in.  I love things that tell a story of something that happened a long time ago.  It\\'s like something you can sit on the front porch with your parents or grandparents and listen to stories of when they were small.  I miss those days.  Now I share stories with my children.  I just hope it\\'s a while before I end up sharing with grandchildren.  If you\\'re into history, I highly recommend this to you as well. I bought this robe as a birthday gift for my son. He loves it and wears it almost daily. The robe is soft and very comfortable. The description says generously sized -- I bought a small/medium for him and it is roomy but not too much. He\\'s 5\\'10&#34; and slender. The robe is large enough for him to wrap up in, but not so large it is bothersome. The description says 3/4 length sleeves, which is the only thing incorrect. The sleeves are full length on my son. I am happy with the purchase, and so is my son. I would recommend it to others and I would buy it again. Bought these from another vendor.  Great pants.  Comfortable,  easy to remove and reattach  lower leg portion even when wearing them. They launder very well. The belt is useless, otherwise , my only complaint is that my size is not available on Amazon. Still, a solid 5 star rating! A super soft shirt and the print was perfect! Most of the fan rip just by opening them up, so wasted money... You must love it! TEE-TS!  I got a large, and it fits like all my other large band t\\'s My daughter loves these bows and loves having such a variety to choose from. The quality is great and there\\'s a bow for every occasion. I received these bows at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review, but and I\\'m so glad that I took a chance on them! I love these bows.  Initially I thought the size might be too large, but they\\'re not, they look great on my 6 1/2 yr olds hair.  The construction is very nice.  They have alligator clips without the teeth so they slide in easily and don\\'t snag her hair.  The colors are beautiful and it\\'s a great variety. Our toddler is just getting enough hair to have bows, so I was very excited about this pack.<br /><br />The bows are large, essentially \\'cheer\\' size. They cover the entire back of the head of our 1.5 year old. The colors are very bright. The bows are well made and fastened securely to the clip. The clip itself is the smooth alligator style &#60;.<br /><br />They are very lovely and unique. Great gift idea!<br /><br />I received this product at a promotional discount in order to test the product and leave an unbiased review. I purchased this item and it arrived after a couple of weeks. I got the size that fit 8-10 and when I tried it on it ran way too small. Considering that I\\'m a size 6 in dresses, the sizes are way off for me. It\\'s very low cut and short. I plan on returning it. Do not waistttttttttttt your money. This is the worseeeeeeee. The material is like spandex, not jersey like, nothing like the picture. Nothingggggg. I want a refund NOWWWWðŸ˜\\xa0ðŸ˜\\xa0ðŸ˜\\xa0 Beautiful and true to size but you could get it alot cheaper from other vendors .â™¡. I Love the way this looks on me it\\'s the best thing ever! As a who via I am seriously drawn to anything Dr Who related.  I saw this shirt and had to have it.  When it came in I was beside myself.  The graphics on the shirt are tip notch.  The fabric is kind of like one of those work out shirts in texture and it is a more stretchy material.  I was very impressed with the quality of the seams as well as the eveness of the stitching. This is definitely a shirt any who fan needs in their wardrobe.  It is lightweight and very comfortable.  I am very thrilled with my purchase.  I highly recommend this shirt for the quality of the graphics as well as the quality of the actual materials and workmanship.<br /><br />I dI\\'d receive a discount in exchange for am honest review however if I don\\'t want this stolen then I will need to buy another one for my daughter. Hillarious! We love it! The saying is just too clever. We even got complimented while out in public. :) I hate the drawstrings. The ones i ordered cam3 with a hokey blue and red colored strings that didnt match the sweatshirt. Im pissed. So here is the deal...a complimentary sample of these were included in another order from this same company. It is not normally a style that MrJavajunki would normally wear - to put it mildly. In the decades of being together, I\\'ve never seen him wear anything remotely like these. Being an old-school sort, he calls these &#34;man panties&#34; and seemed to alternate between insulted and suspicious when I suggested he give them a try. Because these are not his norm, this review is based solely and exclusively on the quality of the material and workmanship. These are made from bamboo which seems like an odd material at first but which makes a lot of sense - it\\'s cool and breaths a lot like cotton but is tougher. These are well made, can be tossed directly into the washing machine without worry and while MrJavajunki isn\\'t personally very comfortable due to the style, these fit the way they are intended to fit (go one size up due to Asian sizing versus US). Complimentary sample provided for evaluation. Very comfy , and looks great. love it and want buy 1 more. Great! worth the money because itlooks great!! Quality is great and shipping was fast despite coming from China! My girlfriend loves it! I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. This product is very well made. Stretchie material and thick enough to feel cery comfortable. 5 stars I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. It fits PERFECTLY!! It is made with stretchie fabric and also thick. My packaged arrived before the expected delivery date. Thank you THIS IS INSANELY SMALL! save your time and money do not buy. I am a medium so I got an XL. believe it or not it wouldn\\'t go over my shoulders. terrible design, made in china seller doesn\\'t refund bc shipping is too high A+ This onesie is so cute! My grandson got it to wear for his baby pictures, and he is the cutest little Batman! It\\'s really nice quality, and she got it really fast, which was great because she didn\\'t find it until it was a week until pictures! Great response time. We can never get enough of Batman! Arrived right on time and fits perfectly! These are my favorite socks in the whole wide world. I love them so much that I bought a whole lot of them and wear them all the sockin time. This line is always coming out with great products and they always arrive on time! I just cant get enough! My son will probably never know the old days of the boom box, but I love the design! Just a skater boy to be :) I love this company. The print on the shirt does not appear like it does on the picture. The print is way to small. Love it..Perfect to my body. Sexy shape!! Perfection!  I am so in love! I orderd three more dresses last night! Came very fast! Amazing quality.  Its beauitful! Thank you so much! My new favorite clothing carrier. Received item sooner than expected. Great top to wear in the summer with a pair of shorts. Lightweight and airy! I LOVE IT, SO GREAT ! Great wallet, lightweight and can hold a lot. One thing I wish I knew before I bought it was that the clip is green and not purple/green Thanks I\\'m 5\\'2&#34; 105lb ordered small.<br />The length ends barely below my ass. Beautiful, comfortable and flattering with the bias cut.  What more could you ask?  The handpainted flowers around the hem are lovely, somewhat reminiscent of vintage Asian textiles.  The straps are adjustable at the back, and the handkerchief hem is very well done.<br /><br />I said the fit was somewhat small, as I prefer something loosely fitting to sleep in.  If you do too, you might think of ordering one size up.<br /><br />I was provided this product for review. The color is not exactly what I wanted, but it will work...so it will do what I planned for it! I am LOVING this dress!  The cut is absolutely phenomenal.  Everything about this dress screams quality.  I was hoping that when I tried on the dress that I would love it just as much as I fell in love with the advertisement photo, but since I can be quite picky with my clothing I wasn\\'t holding my breath.  Taking it out of the package, I noticed right away that the fabric used in the manufacturing of this dress was good quality.  It is a somewhat thick and heavy fabric that has a nice stretch to it.  The robin egg blueish color is one of my favorites and was one of the reasons I was so excited to receive this.  The dress was true to color, I was thrilled about that.  I love the length which is just at the top of my knee.  I am 5 feet tall so it may end up a tad shorter on someone of a more standard height.  The fabric falls beautifully, and I really fell in love with the seams of this dress.  there are seams that go down the bust of the dress in the front which make this a very well fitting dress.  The waistline is nice and high and the skirt flows beautifully.  The off the shoulder cut is fantastic!  It looks lovely.  This is a very nice and comfortably fitting dress.  Since I struggle between a medium and a large I went ahead and ordered this in large and I am glad I did.  Great fit.  I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This is a very well made dress! It fits perfectly and accentuates my curves. It hugs the body so a size up would not hurt but i find the fit flattering even if its a bit hard to get off.<br /><br />It is flowy at the bottom and at 5ft even it comes approximately to my knees. The arm sleeves fit well and it looks good with a black bra on. Its soft and warm, a great fall dress. It would look great with a bolero or shrug too! Easy to dress up or down this is my new LBD.<br /><br />Note - I have recieved this item in exchange for an honest review. [[VIDEOID:1c95673f27989c6c2600f2d99daf5877]]I have been searching for dresses to wear on a up coming California trip. Since my area climate is always cold I wanted fun Summer clothing that would be perfect for humid hot weather climates! This is a lovely dress and I am surprised by the fit and quality. I am 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\" and this is the perfect cocktail length dress.<br />**I received a free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. Nice,but material is very,very thin Awesome shirt I love the shirt don\\'t get me wrong by the sleeves are a little tight on my arms. If you guys are a medium get a large if you like room when you wear t-shirts. I love this shirt, but order a size up. I am a large, and so I ordered a large. The large was a bit too small for me. Definitely get the next size up.<br />Besides this, awesome shirt and awesome quality!! Alright. So there are some positives and negatives about this sweatshirt. I ordered a large, and I thought it would fit tight, but it was big for me. I\\'m short and somewhat stocky but the arms were way too long but, the waist had fit perfectly. I take lessons all through the year and this is extremely warm and has some fleecy smooth warm texture so this shirt/sweatshirt will be great for winter riding. it seems to have been made well which is good. I love that it was cheap and I think I get what I paid for. The white letters were washed out white, not as white as the picture. If there was a star between okay and liking it I think I would be in the middle, so a 3.5 :) This is a beautiful dress? The material  is exceptional. Unfortunatly I have to return it because it is to large for me. I would recommend ordering down one size. Let me start off by saying that this dress is absolutely gorgeous and high quality. The detailing and stitching is precise and accurate. A very high quality item indeed. HOWEVER, the whole dress is entirely see through. The skirt is made with a sheer chiffon like material that can be remedied by wearing a slip. The from and back of the top would be okay if you wear a white bra otherwise you could see the color of your bra. The sides are crocheted so that\\'s not covering anything. Solutions to this would be to wear a white bandeau top or tank and a slip BUT it is a summer dress and I do not want to have to layer all those clothes, that is why I only gave it 3 stars. I am not sure if I am keeping this dress so I have not washed it and cannot say how it holds up after wear.<br /><br />** I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.** Beautiful dress but it didn\\'t fit.  I will have to give it away as a gift.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price for my biased review I got the dress for my wife and she loves it! it fits quite well and appears to be a good quality product. The stitching is nicely done end even, and it looks beautiful!<br /><br />* I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review * This shirt is way to small!! I even went up a size and it fit me like a medium!!!<br /><br />You would have to go up at least 3 sizes to have it fit like the picture show.<br /><br />Even thought the fit was completely wrong, the feel of it was extremely soft!<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a review. I ordered the XL per the size chart. I normally wear an 8, it\\'s fits great. A little longer than I expected, which I am glad about. It looks great with leggings, or jeans. The material is extremely soft and flowy. Hand wash, line dry. I found a few loose threads in the seams. Other than that, it is made well, and fits well. love the grey color, it is dark enough that you don\\'t have to wear a tank underneath.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. Opinions are my own. Excellent value for the price.Love the weight and color of this shirt. This sweatshirt fits perfectly and looks a little more feminine than other sweatshirts I\\'ve owned.I will buy more This bathing suit is absolutely amazing.  I\\'m extremely happy with it although I have yet to actually wear it outside my house. I also think anyone wanted to see the color and how it fits on me. Just pay it :) 5 stars!! Liking this shirt very much. Not only does it bring in conversations with those who were actually around to vote during that time. But it starts people asking you questions. I love that it fits great. Nice and soft. The color does not seem to run and fade fast. The length is also a nice one I have found a few to be super short and this is not a problem. It has a good stretch to it so it would also be nice to sleep in if need be. But what I adore is that it is not to tight. I hold much of my weight in my chest and belly and I do not feel that this is cutting me off or trying to suck me in.<br /><br />I received this t-shirt for free/discounted price in exchange for my own personal thoughts and opinion. I am 5ft and this fits perfectly, it stops by knees. The cloak is the same as the picture and extremely soft! It also came on time when shipped. I love this purchase. I really like this skirt - but I just wish it wasn\\'t as poof-y. But I was so happy that when I got it and tried it on, it has shorts underneath the skirt! I usually wear bike shorts underneath dresses or skirts, and I love that this one has shorts. The material is nice, and is super cute.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I love it but i was very shocked that it didnt have buttons only a wrap around belt for closure  Im gonna make it work and its adorable Got this as a gift and I love how comfortable it is to wear besides the compliments I get from the hubby. Got it for my girl as a gift since she has been mentioning she wants something to help her with her curves. It was a 50/50 she would be happy or she would be insulted. Lol but she was happy that I got it for her and she likes it. Says it\\'s good material. I don\\'t mind the way it feels either ; ) I have served in Special Operations for more than 20 years, and taking care of my feet is a priority.  I am very choosey when it comes to what I put on my feet.  I have finally found a sock that can stand up to the test and the Sawtooth running sock does.  Its perfect design and flawless fabric are key to its performance.  I can\\'t wait to wear this sock on my next marathon.  So far I haven\\'t gotten any blisters or hot spots.  The mesh design on top helps dry the sock quickly.  I can\\'t wait to see Murph on a trail one day running to thank him for a great product.  However, the biggest plus is their contribution to the Wounded Warrior foundation.  De Oppresso Liber!! So far they are awesome. Did a 6 mile run while pushing my 30lb three year in a BOB cart, followed by a 4 mile hike. My wife wants a pair too, just not in black. These are a winner. I purchased these for my husband and he has found the fit to be excellent. They stay in place with no sliding in the heel. LOVE this top!<br />this is a featherlight, rust colored top with cut out shoulders, and the color is exactly as shown in the photo!<br />Looks flattering, covers the belly and shows off the bust in a great way!<br />I paired it with a nice pair of jeans, and have worn it with high heels, sandals, and even dressy flip flops.<br />long enough to cover my belly, and while it hugs the bust beautifully, it falls loosely at the bottom which is wonderful for hiding the belly!<br />GREAT find!<br /><br />*provided for my opinion and review Nice hat I love this wallet!  I had one before in a different fabric. It is the best wallet I have ever had!  Excited for my new one since the old one was looking a little shabby, I had it for over six years.  Great quality, great organizational features!! OMG beautiful dresses love love love Good fit and got here fast nice fit. good shirt. fast shipping. Colors look dull. Stones in the saree look cheap. Wife was completely disappointed. Looks like an old saree !! This post is misleading with the statement \\'product of usa\\' when in fact now they are only designed in the USA and made overseas!! Originally they were made in the USA and was worth the money, now not so much! Bad move Shefit!! Let me know when u come back to the states, I will be waiting. This post is misleading with the statement \\'product of usa\\' when in fact now they are only designed in the USA and made overseas!! Originally they were made in the USA and was worth the money, now not so much! Bad move Shefit!! Let me know when u come back to the states, I will be waiting. Hat is not Dewild brand, but Ultra Club. Hat made in Cambodia---not the USA as indicated in description. Bet the Donald would be impressed! I love the colors of this wallet, but the backside change zipper compartment come unzipped sometimes and change falls out, which is a bummer.  But I love the spacious card slots and all the pockets and room in the wallet.  Also my iPhone 6plus fits like a glove... After having it a few weeks I realize it\\'s very cheaply made and zipper even came off.  Parts of it are coming apart.  Very disappointed!! Super soft and comfy, very thick material too. Thank you Nice fit. Very comfortable. Racist shirt So happy I finally have a cute bra on my size!  Im not used to the straps being like these tho. But Im used to being limited to &#34;old granny bras&#34; due to my size. Also I was given an estimated delivery date of September 14-25 and I received them today (August 26) This was so comfortable to sleep in! The material is this soft knit t-shirt material. Honestly though you can\\'t tell. It is very well put together. I felt absolutely beautiful and sexy wearing this. I also did not get tangled up in it in my sleep.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Beautiful<br />SOFT!!<br />comfortable<br />doesn\\'t wrinkle<br />easy to wash<br />My husband loves it ;)<br />Lace is even really soft<br />not itchy<br /><br />Cons:<br />None as of yet. Will update if any come up.<br /><br />Just so you know:<br />I love this! I got the blue, it is a beautiful color. This is really well made as far as seams and stuff go. The only part I question it the clasps on the straps. I can\\'t feel them or anything but They seem like they could break easily. With that being said. I have slept in this several times now and washed and so far no problems. I did receive this for an honest review, and honestly so far so good.I definitely think it is worth what they are asking for it price wise currently $12.99 - $16.99.<br /><br />Heather Stanhouse review I passed along this woman\\'s sleepwear to my wife who wrote the following about it:<br /><br />&#34;The Ekouaer Womens nightgown I received in exchange for an honest review consists of a long camisole slip style that is made of a soft cotton like material. The nightgown is trimmed on the bodice with a very pretty lace. The nightgown is sexy but sweet and provided me with both comfort and style. I enjoyed wearing and reviewing this beautiful nightgown.&#34; I have this in black, size medium.  It\\'s pretty stretchy fabric so I probably could\\'ve gone down a size and still had it fit.  (I have several items from Ekouaer and their sizing has been getting better and better for the US market.)<br /><br />This is cute and well-made (no loose seams, holes, threads sticking out, etc.).  I\\'m using it as a slip beneath black/dark skirts that are a little too sheer for comfort.  The fabric is dyed evenly (and the fabric has a really nice feel to it) and the lace details are cute.<br /><br />Note on the bra size -- I am a B cup and if you are going to wear this without a separate bra, you would probably not want to be any bigger than a B cup or you might spill out.  It doesn\\'t have any built-in support.  That\\'s not a bad thing, and it\\'s fairly evident from the images, I think, but it is just something to keep in mind.  (It does provide adequate coverage for me, though.)<br /><br />I\\'m going to hand wash this to keep it nice.  It does have a washing instructions label but it is all in symbols (I never remember what they mean) instead of words.  So I figure hand washing is safe.  Overall, a nice product that definitely fit a need I had.<br /><br />Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes. These are my wifeâ€™s comments on the nightgown.  This nightgown (navy color) is very cute with its design and seems to be well made with quality material that is sewn together well.  The navy is a nice color as well.  The nightgown is comfortable to wear with its soft, breathable material.  This medium size fits as it should as she normally wears a medium in this type of clothing.  So far she is pleased with the overall comfort and quality of the nightgown.<br /><br /> 5 stars<br /><br />I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon. Excellent and truly supportive fit. Took others advice and bought one size up. Could not be happier!!! This fits as expected and is very cool looking as a casual hang out shirt.<br />I received this product at a discount for my review. Nice casual dress of good quality, nice fitting.<br />I ordered a Large, I am 5,6 and 140 lb and fits nicely.<br />The material is better that I expected, a soft and light cotton.<br />I definitely recommend the dress as well as the provider. Got a fast delivery as well. For the price, the material is SO cheap. Don\\'t waste your money. It\\'s an awkward potato sack shape and the collar is all misshapen with poor seams. I really don\\'t like this dress. The item is great. Looks exactly like the picture, and is durable. This swimsuit is sold in Japan sizes, so to the negative reviewers about size, keep that in mind. If you are usually a Large, you\\'d order an XXL. Very good swimsuit, just check the Japan size chart before you order. I love the color of these, it is a beautiful bright pink. The lace is very nice, delicate but not to much where it will rip easily. They have a decent amount of stretch and the initial stiffness should soften with use and wash. They are one size fits all, but the tag states Medium, and they seem a bit small even for a medium. If they had a tad more stretch to them it may be a little more suitable to say one size fits all. The fit is nice, they arent as high as a regular hi-cut bikini in the leg but dont ride right in the crease of the leg either. The rise is agood with a low-rise jean. They do have a reasonable amount of give in the butt, however if you\\'ve got a &#34;booty&#34; expect them to be slightly snug, and they seem to ride up the cheek a bit, which is acceptable and expected.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I did hand wash them right away, in cool water, as I do with all clothing items I buy or receive. I hung them to dry and they dried fairly quickly. As soon as I put them on I loved them! These sexy low rise trunk undies are exactly that, sexy! They came in a size medium which is what I originally wear. I like them to not be so big in the back, and these were just that. The front covers as much as the picture in the items description shows. It is a very comfortable cotton low rise underwear and the color I got was Rose2. I can only imagine that they look just as sexy in all the colors available! Being 5\\' 7&#34;, 135 pounds and hips are a 39&#34;, the low rise trunks do rise up on your booty. They rise up half way around the booty like a Rio look. It is comfortable because the fabric has a nice stretch to it and the lace is not bothersome at all. These do not fall in the crease of your leg, they go slightly above it. That way you don\\'t feel any uncomfortable friction while wearing them. They won\\'t rip easily either thanks to the nice makeup of the materials used. I appreciate the opportunity to receive this item for free for my honest and unbiased review. I bought two dresses, one ivory, one white, for pictures. As some reviews mentioned the last layer doesn\\'t flare out as the picture would suggest. I had to trim loose, hanging thread from both the dresses I bought. Still,for the price, a great buy. I had taken the advice of previous reviews and ordered slightly larger sizes then I would have normally, the dresses fit perfectly by doing so, if I had ordered their normal sizes they would have been snug and my daughters are both petite. The white color is somewhat see through in the skirt, my daughter initially had pink underwear on and the color showed through, I put white underwear on her and problem was solved. The ivory color did not have the same issue.  They received a ton of compliments in their dresses, overall I am happy with the dress(es) and the purchase. Love the jeans, fits perfectly!!!!! Arrived 4 days after expected .. but size and style were perfect [[VIDEOID:721fcd237734dab98a7c7d982e8bbd98]]Nice simple and cute waist corset.Great for petites or short torso women. Breathable material. It helps to shape the waist, gives a good midsection and back support specially if you work sitting for long ours this helps to take the pressure off your back. I love that it has a cute lace details and it\\'s a great match to spice up sexy lingerie, it can be used as a waist shaper on daily bases or just a piece to match costumes, sexy lingeries etc... You can get creative with it : ) THANKS!! Harder than Hades to make a purchase.  10+ tries to get to &#34;add to cart&#34; then it would disappear when I tried to fill in the size and color which I could not seem to get done even before.<br />Also I should be able to make my comments at least somewhat anonamously. I went a size up! fits great . looks just like picture.. Great quality. HaHahaha I really love the MeMoi style shaper. I\\'ve bought the Flexees before and find the MeMoi far better for controlling my bulges! They look great under my white slacks. The inseam is 14 inches when purchased. That shrinks down an inch or so after washing ,but will stretch out again.  When I wear one under polyester slacks and my inner thighs rub together, shapers can cause my slacks to ride up due to static created by the rubbing. But Static Guard solved that issue and now my slacks and skirts flow over my shapers with no problem.. They are opaque. Also they don\\'t pill, snag, or run. They are very durable and wash well-keeping their shaping properties. I just bought 7 more because they are quite comfortable and not too hot during summer days. They are also affordably priced.. If you\\'re going to have a shirt attacking the intellect of others, it should be grammatically correct. Trite perfect fit!!! quality is good!!! and design is great!!!<br />love this product i bought swoon women cloth before from swoonla.com swoon women cloth is the best price and quality also nice fit and fabric  i am happy that finally swoon women cloth is selling from amazon thank you so much swoon women cloth and amazon love this will probably order more! very comfortable This shirt is sooooo comfortable . Fits perfect ... very light and im absolutely in love... I want every color.... This Wallet is cleverly designed and easy to use. The o\\'rings fit perfectly in place and firmly keep the two pieces together. The O\\'rings are replaceable too making the the wallet itself built for life. I have managed to get over half an inch stack inside without any issues and I have used it on nights out with just license and some cash. In both cases I found it to be comfortable to carry and easy to use. The Copper has a lush heavy feel and the look is amazing. It is defiantly the only wallet anyone has ever complemented me on.<br /><br />The lack of branding, the excellent design and the beautiful aesthetic together make for a unique item that stands out from run of the mill wallets. Considering I usually destroy my leather wallets every other year or so I am looking forward to saving money in the future with this item that should last me the rest of my life. These are GREAT for cold weather.  We put our infant in a diaper and these to sleep and they were so easy to change diapers in and were comfy and warm! I love it it fit as I expected and the product texture love it thank you Arrived in a bag and the fabric was so shiny metallic that I was worried it would not be my style. However once I tried it on and tied the belt, it looked fabulous. The collar is really cute. It\\'s a versatile dress which is what I wanted - to pick kids up from school, do shopping or go out on date night. It is a bit short, so I will wear shorts underneath. Maybe if my thighs were more toned I would not need shorts. A taller person would definitely need shorts/leggings. I\\'m only 5\\'4&#34; and I ordered a small size dress. Disclaimer: I received a discount in exchange for an honest opinion. Material: The material is shiny silky cloth and of a very good quality. The material made this dress light weight and elegant appearance. Easy to carry this dress in a travel bag as a spare dress.<br /><br />Design: very nice design that I liked this dress so much. The design made this dress fabulous and expensive looking.<br /><br />Color: floral color on black background is always great and fabulous looking.<br /><br />Fitting: fits exactly as expected.<br /><br />Overall a perfect dress for every occasion. I recommend this dress.<br />I received this product at a discounted price for an exchange of an honest review. I chose the black and pink floral babydoll dress and it runs slightly small. About half a size I\\'d say. I\\'m a true size Large and it fits, but just a little snug. It\\'s mostly tight across the chest, and unfortunately the buttons there are just for show so I can\\'t open them and wear a cami underneath! I\\'m in the process of losing some post-baby weight, however, so hoping this will fit better in about 10 lbs down. It has a cute and flattering fit overall! The sleeves especially, and it drapes nicely in all the right places. If you have a large bust just order up one size and you should be fine. Everyone does suggest to order one size up when purchasing any clothing from China. I\\'m usually a medium, but was hesitant to buy the large. I ended up going with the medium, and it fit perfectly! It is a SUPER cute dress, I love it. I am a little short, so it does go a little past the knee, but that\\'s how I like it! It also took a couple weeks to arrive, but I was in no rush! Thank you! I did receive this dress at a discount in exchange for an honest review. Glad I got approved for it! I like these dress . This is good for fall . I bought these because I need a new wardrobe . This is perfect for the new season . I\\'m wearing based on what the  coming weather is . I\\'m happy with my new dress .<br /><br />I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest , unbiased review . This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way . Thank you very much for the sweatshirt, and how good product is. I would truly recommend friends and family to buy from you! Love it but took awhile to get as expected. Love T-shirt!!! As advertised. This is a very comfortable snood. If I ever want to put on a haircovering this is what I pick to wear. I recommend this head covering. nice shoes cute! It was everything I was hoping it to do. Only thing it was to small for my son. I suggest getting a size bigger but it was just as the ones Sports Authority sells yet at a lower more affordable price. I sold it to my customer and she\\'s very happy with it as well. Koloa surf at joes USA is a great place to buy from with excellent prices on excellent products, with fast shipping!! I recommend them highly! this is a great shirt with awesome graphics!! Love this place Nice shirt but I wish I ordered medium instead of small size not worth for returning it ,,,,, I love this bra. Comfortable and sexy. Exactly as I wanted. Material is durable and sheer in the back. 4 bra closures. Kool shirt. Liked that fact that it wasn\\'t the kind that choked ur neck. LOVED IT, FIT WELL - THE ADJUSTABLE STRAPS ARE VERY HELPFUL FOR US LARGER CHESTED WOMEN These pants are fantastic.  Wearing them to work on a Blue Friday resulted in no less than 3 people asking me to order them some.  In the a.m. there were only small sizes left and in the afternoon, none were left -- w/o a promise of replenishment to Amazon stores.  Amazon should definitely bring them back because they were UBER popular. Absolutely great! Very good fabric, good quality, fits perfect. My Mom was looking for a proper dress for a very long time, she\\'s size M, but she has a tummy she doesn\\'t like, and she feels uncomfortable in most dresses. In this one she looks like a 20-year-old girl! An extremely feminine dress, makes the waist thin, beautiful lines. The knees are covered, so it\\'s a very elegant dress for any occasion. Beautiful V-cut - not too much, not too little. The belt is a very good addition, it\\'s long enough to play with it and to try it in different styles. Just great, Mom is happy like a little baby. :) Thank you for this wonderful dress! Wonderful dress!!! Extremely similar style like Kim Kardashian\\'s, but I feel this one is pretty fit The purple on the socks shown is not actually on the socks. These are just light pink and white socks. No purple. I was VERY disappointed. Reasonably stylish  long sleeve T-shirt, good for my every day running. Seemed to stain easily, but more my fault than the shirt. Its cute & in style. And for the price, it is worth it compared to what you will find in the mall.I love the way it hugs my body,I usually wear a m,l but knowing China sizing I got the xxl it fits me great not too clingy a bit short so I will wear it with some white or black skinny jeans. Very nice color,Super comfy and cute,I am 180 5\\'2&#34; and ordered xxl (usually a large). LOVE IT!!! Really like the coverage. Love it! Fits well and it\\'s comfortable. I carried my 1 year old the entire time I was in the water and it didn\\'t shift or expose me in anyway. I\\'m a 38dd and usually between an 8 and 10, so based on the reviews I got the 10 and it fits perfectly! CRAP!!! Poor;y made, NOT Red, Orange!! Great customer service, shipping was fast!! The scarf is beautiful and every bit of what the picture shows. Highly recommended!,would buy again Received this today. Dress was not the same material as described and was so short it should have been a blouse! I am returning this for a refund Even big women still can be so sexy with this dress and i like it so much. I like it so much, looks good and comfy. want to buy more,for friends. Very comfortable. Excellent value. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />I received this item quickly and it arrived as described.  It is a three piece set.  The top, a pair of elastic band shorts and the tail piece.  It seems very high quality and the stitching seems to hold up very well.<br /><br />My favorite part is that one can still walk while wearing the tail piece.  It is designed to look mermaid like while not obstructing your child from walking.  Love this and can\\'t wait for halloween. This is a beautiful tunic, that being said I was terribly disappointed when it arrived to see at least 2 dozen snags in the embroidery. It was the last one in stock and so I can\\'t return it for a new one. I have never seen anything offered as new that was in such rough shape. I considered repairing it as I really wanted to wear it to an event next month, but paying over a $100.00 for a top and to have so many hanging threads and loose loops just isn\\'t acceptable. The colors are true to the photo, and I ordered a large, which fits as expected. I\\'m really bummed. Good fit, good blend of fabrics.  Feels almost like an Express brand fabric or as soft as ring-spun cotton. Fits well.  The fabric is soft but quite thin.  I like the thinness and comfort, but the white is very see-through.  Perhaps other colors would be better. Adds swag for any LOlifer I was hesitant to get this because it was cheap.They ship within the time expected which was pretty quick. I ordered a size B and was fairly pleased that these fit perfectly .It feels like you aren\\'t wearing anything at all.  After you wear them just wash it and have them dry then it\\'s good as new. I purchased this t-shirt at a very deep discount during a promotional period and have promised to provide my honest opinions and thoughts about it. I like the shirt very much. I got an extra large and it fit as expected. It was soft and comfy. The design is exactly as shown and I was very happy with it. I love this shirt, it made me feel so much satisfied and happy. The material and quality is very good. It\\'s very soft and expensive looking material. Also the design is fabulous, its very attractive, looks really nice in person, and perfect quality too on how they printed the words and design on it. I cant really believe how nice it is in person, and i would really be happy to recommend this to my friends and relatives, because this is very cute shirt, good quality, and fit right as i expected.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted price in exchange of my honest opinion. I really really really loved it!!! Perfect fit to my tiny figure. My husband was happy when he saw me wearing it during his birthday....Proud wife having a shirt like this....The materials was soft, love the color. Black is one of my favorite.

I am super excited to show off my love for my husband all the time now!<br />I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review. its a super cute shirt but its suppose to be a xl and def feels more like a tight large so a little disaapointed in the sizing<br />*I received this product discounted in exchange for my review. Quality of the t-shirt is top notch, very nice and smooth. Size might be a little undersized but fit my wife fine.  I recommend this brand of t-shirts.  I received this at a discount to leave an honest review. I received this item at a discounted price for my honest review. Cute design. nice This product is amazing. I love the product material and the fit is amazing! Great item.  Better than I expected. fit perfect. looks great on :) Opened up the package! It is a sweet shirt! I LOVE IT! Can\\'t wait to wear it tonight! I\\'ve got the last one suckers.I have the red and black snorkel which looks amazing In Its own right but this watch Is absolutely stunning. the coined finish case gives an eye popping sheen that shifts on the light. get It! These pants feel amazing!! I ordered the cerise in size 16/18 and they came in size 20/22. The size doesn\\'t really matter that much because they\\'re supposed to be baggy. I\\'m short, so the fitted bottoms are perfect and don\\'t squeeze. I\\'d buy these again!! They also came 2 weeks earlier than expected! I got this a size up, I wear a pant size 8/9 in U.S. so I ordered the 10-12 size. Got it really fast, before the dates that it said it would arrive. Little hard to put on but once I got it on I loved it! By far my most happiest purchase. Boosted my confidence almost immediately! Beautiful dress.love it!!! Very heavy soft, smooth, shiny material. Colors look like photo thankfully.I love it! i\\'m 5\\'5, 32B weighing 125 lbs and i got the mediumï¼Œ Fits perfect and not too tight.No bra needed for this dress is thick and well made.Shipping was great! Way ahead of schedule. The dress was really nice but was extremely small. It was about 2 sizes smaller than what i normally wear. Perfectly made and very sturdy with plenty of room. Whether you wear jeans, shorts, khaki`s or slacks, it fits perfect in front or back pocket without being noticed. You wont be disappointed. Runs small in the bust. It is not the dress shown on the model. The pattern is printed on the fabric and the belt detail does not go around the back. The lining stops at the knee. It\\'s fun though for the price but the photos are misleading. I really liked the shirt, it fots perfectly the only issue is that it was sent with milticolored buttons so i had to get them replaced myself I really like the dress and think the necklace makes it a little dressy or you can dress it down. But the only con to the dress is that the white is really see-through.  I was planning on wearing to a beach wedding, now I have to find a slip to wear under it. Beautiful skirt, came sooner than anticipated, highly recommend This dress is such a great fine at an even better price. I am usually a true size small, (2, 34a), the medium fit well but was slightly big at the boob area. I am 5\\'7 and the dress is a great length, a little see through but nothing a slip can\\'t fit. Love it! Too big Everything arrived as described and the instructions for application were helpful. This dress said a size 8 (M) but fit MUCH tighter than the dress I love from the same company that is a 6- the seamstress made some mistakes here. I am tall and athletic and so it may just be my build (5\\'8/145) and fit a size 6 as long as the torso is accommodating. So many dresses are made for 5\\'5 women. Anyway- Just be warned if you are tall and have a long torso or even above average in the slightest this is not the dress for you. The color was also very &#34;Alice in wonderland&#34; as my husband put it. They make other great dress though with good deal- this one will be going back. This is a very pretty blazer!  The fabric that it is made of is so beautiful, soft and silky.  It is a great fall accessory paired with a sweater, jeans and boots!  The stitching is beautifully done throughout the piece and it is well constructed.  I received this blazer in white and the color is stunning.  It has an elegant feel about it and the fabric flows beautifully.  This blazer is adorned with two pockets, one on either side.  They are nice sized pockets if you were to actually need to use them.  The length is somewhat long, it comes down on my to about my mid thigh, although I am only 5 feet tall so I would imagine most people it wouldn\\'t be so long on.  I felt like the blazer was a little smaller around than it should have been and the fit was a little awkward for me around the front of the blazer.  I thought that the front should have come a little closer together and I think that I would have felt a little more comfortable if it had.  But it\\'s a beautiful piece of clothing and for someone a little less curvy or if you go up a size from what you think you would need it would probably be a better fit for you.  I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. When I saw this sleeveless blazer from Meaneor, I was quite intrigued, thinking that it wasn\\'t like anything else in my wardrobe, so I was excited to give it a try.  Just as the description says, it is a blazer style jacket, with a standard blazer lapel, but without sleeves.  I like the long flowy design.  The description says that the fabric is stretchy, but I really don\\'t feel much &#34;give&#34; to the fabric and wish it had a bit more elasticity, although the fabric does have a nice, soft feel.  I ordered a size Large, which is what I would typically wear and it is a bit small.  I\\'m not sure if it is intended to be able to close all the way across the front of the chest and abdomen (there are no buttons or other closures), but for me it is a bit tight to try to have the two sides meet up and the armholes are also slightly small.  Still just as an open long vest, it looks stylish and adds an interesting fashionable note to my outfit.<br /><br />I\\'m very glad that I was able to order this as a free promotional sample in order to evaluate and provide my honest review. I purchased this for my fiance after his last wallet got destroyed in the wash. It\\'s not super thick which is what he wanted. It\\'s a good size. He can fit his cards and money in it but it\\'s not hard to shove into his pocket. The color matched the picture too which doesn\\'t always happen. It\\'s a good wallet for a good price Very cute swimsuit! I usually wear between a SM-MED. I bought a med and it was slightly loose. I\\'ll purchase another in small. Nice dress for my sister and will buy 1 for myself. What a nice dress.feel confortable on body and looks great. As a patriot myself, I know my son will grow up to be a patriot too! Nice quality, love the material and brand. This company is always making super funny clothes that are still tasteful. I love it This one makes me laugh every time I see my little one in it These are great and hilarious. We picked up this and another for ourselves and a couple for friends. Great gift. great! This is soooooo cute. My daughter adores it! Came faster than it was expected,  and the material is nice. It\\'s a light sweater shirt. [[VIDEOID:a318d6724e97914ed473de52f5183cfa]]I tend to be more modest than most women my age.  The problem with that is that I have a large bust.  Most items for my age tend to show off a lot of cleavage. I also have the problem of getting cold really easy.    I have to say I was so excited by the color options for this.  How is it possible to choose just one color?  I went with black because it goes with everything.    I ordered the XXL because I like things to be a little big to allow for the bust. I have to say that there is more than enough room and that makes me so happy.    I love the one button closure on this because it allows for breathing room for my girls (aka my bust).  The button is pretty as well, just the perfect size for this.    This is made of a stretch material and is very comfortable. You would think that with this certain being so thin that it would not keep you warm but it really does keep me warm.  At the same time it does not over heat me at all, I swear it is just the right combo of cooling and insulating.    Even with it unbutton it still allows me to be modest when I need to be.    I have to say that I am so in love with this Cardigan it\\'s not funny. I love to wear it around my house because I live in Texas and the ac has to be pretty much running all the time to keep the house cool.    I hope that you are just as happy with yours as I am mine (if you can decide on the color lol)    I did get this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I am not compensated in any way for this review. The straps as well as the fringe were not as shown in the picture.  The straps are not as thick as displayed and the fringe drops at an angle(which I like) but are not as long as excepted. Well worth the money, gorgeous dress well put together. Definitely recommend it!! Is not the dress!!!! I wish to same like the picture but they send me a yellow one. The material is cheap I love this shirt and because I thought it would be too small I ordered two sizes larger so it fits almost right. But it is really nice looking and I like it. Really love it. More taupe than it appears in the picture. It fits so well. It is true to size.  Seems very fragile. I will have to be cautious of where I wear it. I will definitely only hand wash this top. There are two good sized pockets on the front which I could not see in the picture, but I like pockets so that is a plus. The stitching and the look of the cardigan may no hold up for a long time, but I am hoping it proves me wrong. It may be delicate and durable. The price is less than $20 so it is not a huge issue if I had to buy another one. I would buy another one too. Its that cute. It also comes in black.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my review. I have now purchased the black one too and I like just as much. From the picture I was expecting a fuzzy sweater, this one is not fuzzy at all. But it is cute and very light! It has a light, airy feel to it. The fabric is very light but does require a shirt, tank or camie underneath. It requires hand wash, the sweater would totally fall apart in the washer.<br />I did not rate it as high as I would have as the material is not that great and after worn once I feel like its going to fall apart.<br />The size is perfect, the color is not white or cream. I would call it a burlap tan/beige color. If you have a cat be careful, like mine he would catch his claws on it. So take careful like it like I have :)<br /><br />Overall I would say its ok for a casual sweater but would be very careful as it may fall apart with a snag. absolutely not like the picture... dont buy! Cheap quality!! It\\'s nothing like the picture do not buy!! Just alerting Amazon to the fact that the title of this item reads:  &#34;GREEN LANTERN/ORANGE EMBLEM-ADULT PULL-OVER&#34; - but the picture is of a black T-shirt that days &#34;Lord of the Fail&#34;, and the description underneath is of the T-shirt.... so, not quite sure what a person will get if they buy this! Perfect fit. I love this clay multi colored coat it\\'s unique and I like that the material feels soft, I thought it would feel more like a tweed and a little scratchy but not at all! The fabric blend is very cool! I am super excited now to wear it in the fall,it fits really well it\\'s a little oversized for me but I love hanging coats on me! The button details are nice and I like the fringe detail on the arms it adds a cool vintage design feel! For under $30 this is the perfect fall coat! This is a great lightweight coat for fall and prints are huge this season! This coat is very nicely sewn tougher, No weird or unsightly seems or loose strands, It also has a nice sheer black lining. The coat is soft and comfortable and very flexible so it moves great layered over lots of clothing too.<br /><br />I love the print and the pretty black and white. The boxy cut is also on trend and super cute and easy to wear with anything. It looks great over a dress or with trousers, jeans, leggings, or shorter skirts. It also looks really great belted too if you want to show off that lovely hour glass figure!<br /><br />This coat is a great deal especially for what you pay. The buttons are also easy to do and undo when getting in and out of this coat.<br /><br />I\\'m a size 6 and tall, and I ordered this in a large and its a perfect fit. I was especially nervous the sleeves wouldn\\'t be long enough for my long arms (i\\'m 5\\'10) but its a perfect fit!<br /><br />I adore this coat and plan on wearing it a bunch this fall as well as taking it into the colder months by layering up underneath. I love that thanks to the boxy style of this coat, it\\'s easy to wear over lots of layers!<br /><br />I received this coat at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I purchased the black and white zig zag trench coat. So pretty and very very well made. I don\\'t know that I would call this a coat, but it is moderately heavy and should keep warm for fall with a light shirt under it. I ordered the small as I usually would and it is slightly big on me. It is 100% polyester with a 100% rayon lining. It is dry clean only which is a little disappointing for me. I am afraid that I will mess up the stitching if I wash it at home. It looks as it does in the picture so no surprises there. It is wonderful quality and I am really excited to wear it when it gets a little cooler outside. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my review. For $13, even if it was more $, I like it! It fits well after some adjustment. I\\'m 5\\'5 and NOT skinny. I got xxl because I knew it was from China. I usually wear xl.  It hides my not-so-perfect spots and top is supportive. This was so horrible. The top is absolutely nothing like the picture. It\\'s unstructured, horribly made, the part that\\'s supposed to be tied fits more loosely than the rest of the top and it looks more like a sports bra than anything else. So so bad. The bottoms aren\\'t too horrible but the open parts are more forward than I thought. They\\'re supposed to fit more to the side. I\\'d return it if it didn\\'t cost more to ship than I paid for the suit. Looks nothing like the picture , top and bottom completely different. I am so upset Great for a She-ra fans of the original series. Fit better than expected, would recommend for any classic car fan. I bought a size Large and it fit perfectly. The fabric is very soft and comfortable. I am definitely thinking of buying more This is a waste of money. I received it on time but it\\'s the worse quality that I\\'ve ever seen. You can tell it\\'s worse than a copy of an original dress. I thought I was buying something nice. I just lost my money.... Very soft , a little worn looking with the print itself.Great color and like the print on the front and back.My husband wears a large but I went with the x large and it was a good fit. The dress is very pretty and I like it a lot Very sexy and form kitting my husband loved it! When buying clothes online you never know if you are getting factory rejects. The quality of the seems and the alignment of the pattern is always something that worries me about shopping for clothes online. Each seem was nicely sewn. The logo is center except the &#34;6&#34; in 2016 is slightly too far to the right. The paint looks is described. It was true to size and didn\\'t shrink when it was washed. Overall I\\'m pleased with the quality of this T-Shirt I just wish the 6 wasn\\'t so far off. (Compare my photo to the original ad)<br /><br />PROS:<br />Soft material<br />Fits as expected<br />Preshrunk<br /><br />CONS:<br />6 is too far to the right compared to other numbers and letters<br /><br />Ratings (Out of five stars):<br />Cotton softness: *5*<br />Size Accuracy: *5*<br />Paint Quality: *4*<br />Comfort: *5*<br />Value: *5*<br /><br />Overall rating: 24 out of 25 stars / 4.8 Star Average<br /><br />I hope you enjoyed this review. If you have any questions about my experience please leave me a comment. I will be happy to follow up on my experience with this product.<br /><br />I received this product complimentary from Hot Ass Tees for quality testing purposes; all opinions expressed are my own. I love just hanging out with my lil man so this fits perfectly! the belt is great and the service is super great. Great socks! Been using these every day for a year now. They\\'re very durable and comfortable. Just so you know it\\'s a see through dress. So your bra and underwear will show. That\\'s the only bad thing about the dress Love that adjusts to whatever size your baby\\'s head is. Don\\'t have to worry if too tight! LOVE it! I ordered the navy.  Received denim.  Fabric is very soft and comfortable.  Do not care for substitution Material is so soft and thin.  Great for very hot and humid weather.  Love the length and fit.  Wish I had the funds to buy every color. This shirt is very good quality.  The material is thick cotton.  The printing is well done.  After washing the color is still vibrant.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. Almost see through fabric and shrunk when washed but I did get a lot of compliments on this.  I love the bright red color. The material is a little heavier than I was expecting, but is still a fun shirt. With all shirts with this type of print on it, don\\'t put it in the dryer to prolong screening life. My bf liked it, so that\\'s always a good thing. Bought this for my son who loves it. It arrived quickly and packaged nicely. It is a soft, durable cotton and the image on the front is great vivid colors. I have washed this twice in cold water and there was minimal shrinkage and no fading so I would say it is a keeper. Plus it makes my son giggle when he wears it, he says he feels &#34;fancy&#34; it is a really nice t-shirt for the price. The tag just tears off with ease so you can have nothing rubbing against the neck line and that is nice. The shirt is a classic and timeless fitting for all occasions. Or none depends on who you are! Really happy with the shirt Got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it! He says that it fits wonderfully and that the decal is high quality. He\\'s getting a lot of wear out of it already.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. All thoughts and opinions contained herein are my own. good gag gift I bought this shirt for my husband not expecting he\\'d actually wear it out just possibly around the house but he really loves it. The shirts do say they are pre-shrunk so I ordered a Large and it fit perfectly with a little extra room just in case it does shrink any more. The design on the shirt is fresh and un cracked and for those wanting to avoid it messing up I would suggest turning the shirt inside out before washing and hang to dry do not put it in the dryer. A really cute shirt overall and popular for those wanting to make a statement This shirt is fantastic! I got it as surprise for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loved it! The colors are super vibrant & the quality is fantastic. The tshirt itself is made super well and I can tell its going to hold up for a while. My biggest surprise came from the fact that I expected the tuxedo part to be sort of poorly ironed on... but it is actually put on there super well! To be honest my boyfriend didn\\'t really have a specific need for this shirt but I was offered the shirt at a discounted price in exchange for my review. My boyfriend always needs shirts so I figured why not? Everytime he wears it out people compliment it & frequently ask where he got it, needless to say this shirt scored me some brownie points :-) these were really cute online and are ok in person but way cheaper quality than expected i mean it\\'s supposed to make you look as if wearing a tux but this just looks out of line the fakery i mean the print is not even and is not in the place like it should be someone misprinted but sent anyway When dressing my Son, I require all his clothes to be comfortable, fun and classy. I am so happy to have found Fresh Tees Tuxedo Shirt. My son loves to wear it and he feels more confident. When he wears it I call him &#34;Mr. Fancy Shirt.&#34; I enjoy everyone asking &#34;Where did you get that?&#34; The shirt fits well and doesn\\'t wrinkle. I have to wash it often, as it is worn often. I have not noticed any fading from the black. I enjoy that is is durable and can withstand some rough and tumble active play.  I received product for free for my opinion. Such a great shirt! Fabric is comfortable, not itchy or anything, Fits well. I really like the design; it says &#34;I\\'m formal, but I\\'m also here to party.&#34; The size fit my son perfectly. The tuxedo is printed on a Hanes tee-shirt. The material is thick and soft. The print has survived a couple washed so far and the shirt still looks new, didn\\'t shrink. The black has not faded. My son is going to use his tuxedo shirt to make a Monopoly Man Halloween Costume. Should be fun to see, and the shirt is high enough quality that it will still be in good shape by the time Halloween comes around. This t-shirts is super cool who needs a tux when you have this t-shirt. My son loves this t-shirt, he would wear it everyday if I didn\\'t tell him to take it off so I could clean it. Super cute and makes for a good laugh! Material good quality and will last thru washes. Fun tuxedo shirt.  I ordered this in size small for my son, who generally wears a size 10-12 in boys.  It\\'s roomy, but not huge on him.  He was pretty impressed.  &#34;I never thought I\\'d get my own tuxedo, Mom!&#34;<br /><br />We are going to use it as part of a slender man costume for Halloween.  With a red tie and some strategically applied sharpie it should be perfect, but you could totally just wear it for fun. I actually ordered one for my husband, too.  He\\'ll just wear it.<br /><br />The shirt is well constructed, the design professionally applied and I think it will wash and wear normally for a tee of this style.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review. Super cute shirt! Reminds me of the 70\\'s. Quality tee shirt material as well, Fruit of the Loom brand. The screen print is perfect, soft & flexible. Won\\'t crack or fade. A great shirt for my teenager who doesn\\'t like to &#34;dress up&#34;. With a pair of dark jeans or pants, it will get a double take. I received this product for a discount in exchange for my unbiased opinion, but does not constrict me to give a positive rating. I was able to get this product for an awesome price to try it out & review. The shirt is very soft & fun!<br />I got this for my 11 year old son, he thought it was so cool, he is actually wearing it to school today, he says his friends think the shirt is awesome.<br />I have washed it a handful of times, shirt has kept the color & design. True to size fit & just as pictured Nice quality t-shirt. Its a very funny shirt to wear to parties. Or great for an informal formal event. My husband really likes this shirt. Ive washed it several times and the color and quality holds up very well. [[ASIN:B013MK0GVC Fresh TeesÂ® Black And White Tuxedo With Bowtie Funny Shirts (2X-Large, Black)]]<br />I got this shirt for my son who is 6ft tall and about 220lbs in fitness, not chunkiness. It fit him beautifully and he was quite excited to get it. We just attended a wedding last month and he did not want to dress up at all, I wish we had found this sooner as my cousin would\\'ve been fine with him wearing it to the wedding and would\\'ve even found it funny. The cloth was soft and my weirdo son was really happy about the &#34;new&#34; scent of the shirt. The seller made sure to package the item with sufficient protection for the shipping process and the item arrived very quickly, in fact we got it sooner than we expected to. There is nothing better than doing business with a company that gets everything right the first time and takes pride in the quality of items they provide. This is what I wish every experience was like, and while I received this item at a discount for my honest review, you can go to my profile to see other reviews and know that I am in fact honest. I not only highly recommend this shirt, but also the seller. Bravo Fresh Tees...BRAVO! Bought this for my husband because I have never seen him in a tuxedo and this is as close as I am going to get, lol.  This was a gag gift that made us both laugh. The size fit exactly as expected and it looks exactly like the picture. It washed well in cold water and low heat and because it is a cotton blend it doesn\\'t shrink. The color held up nicely and it retained it\\'s shape after washing, it didn\\'t stretch out or fade. I got this at a reduced price in exchange for an HONEST and UNBIASED review I got the shirt for my boyfriend, he says he likesT. the quality of the T-shirt. The design doesn\\'t fade very easily, like other shirts. The shirt was quite comfortable. (I slept in the tshirt as well) It is comfortable... i bought this for my 15 year old son to replace his one he grew out of. He loves it. I was able to try it at a discount for my honest opinion. He says if needed he knows where to buy the next one. Doesn\\'t seem to fade in the wash and he was able to wear it all day even at camp where he usually takes off his shirt due to heat or not comfortable itchy fabric. cute shirt! fit as expected. great quality, great seller. I see people wear these all the time and I just knew this would be perfect for my boyfriend.  He is definitely not a dress up guy!  He prefers t-shirts and jeans and would wear them everyday if he could.  However, there are some instances where dressing up is a necessity.....and there are some instances where this shirt would be PERFECT!  I can see him wearing this to a bachelor party or to a backyard barbecue or some outdoor picnic just to be funny.  This is definitely for a wise guy and that he is!  It is not a cheaply made shirt.  You can see from my pic that is is made from heavy cotton yet it is still quite soft and comfy.  It is true to size as he normally wears an XL and this fits like all his others.  He will surely get more laughs the next time he wears it.  I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review. This tshirt was purchased at a discount in exchange for a review.<br />  That being said the fit was great and the colors are so bold and vibrant. It was a replacement for another tuxedo shirt that is just worn out. Love it! Great funny shirt! Fit well and looks great. There is a lot of &#34;plastic&#34; where the graphic is, but isn\\'t annoying or itchy. I received this as a review deal. Nice gag shirt! I saw this shirt on facebook and thought that it\\'s cool! I Bought this for my husband. It true to size and it\\'s good quality thick cotton fabric.<br /><br /> I like the print! We washed it with cold water and just hang dry and it and it didn\\'t shrink or fade. It\\'s very comfortable to use. My husband have had shirt that was fruit of the loom brand and they last a long time. I know that this shirt will last a while too just by the quality.<br /><br />I got this product discounted in exchange for an honest and unbiased review which I provided. So far we\\'re really satisfied with this product. Iâ€™ve always wanted a tuxedo t-shirt for those less than formal moments. I am pretty impressed this is a nice heavy weight cotton t-shirt. Its actually printed on a Fruit of the loom Heavy Cotton t-shirt made with 100% cotton. I uploaded a photo of the tag so you can see. The sizing is fairly accurate. I am 5â€™9â€\\x9d 185 lbs. and normally go between a medium and a large depending on the shirt / brand. I ordered a large here and it was a bit bigger than I anticipated. After a hot water wash and high temp dry it was a bit smaller and fit better. If you frequently go between 2 different sizes of shirts I would recommend you to go with your smaller size when you order this. I received this product at a discount for testing and review purposes. Another great shirt produced from this company. My son lobes it! My son loves this shirt he put it on right after he got it in the mail.The design is super fun and yet simple. It is a gilden brand t shirt and I do like there quality of t shirts. The vinyl that they used for the design didn\\'t lift when I washed the shirt last night. My son said the shirt is comfortable and wasn\\'t itchy or anything. Disclaimer I did get this product at a discount for my honest review I have a 12 year old son who loves funny shirts. He is 5\\'4 and 110. He has broad shoulders and the medium fit him a tad loose but not too loose.<br />The cotton is a nice thick cotton and the design on the shirt is printed on their very nicely. We have had it for a week and we he has worn it as his lounging around the house shirt every single day and every single day I have washed it (we are a family of 6 so laundry is done daily) it has actually held up amazingly well! no fading and no cracking on the design (I have line dried it). I would HIGHLY recommend this brand of shirts because they are a great quality that will last thru abuse!<br />I received this product Free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review Soft comfy fruit of the loom shift with an iron on but its cute, good for the price, great gag gift or for that person in your life who only ever wears tshirts. It does run just a tad bit I feel and it is decent quality. My other concern is that the black of the shirt may fade but the decal will not. It\\'s what you pay for it. And would be great for like a bachelor party or something as a gift. I received this product in exchange for a review and this is my honest opinion and review.<br /><br />OK I\\'ll start by saying that this is my new payday shirt and it will be worn every Tuesday from now on. (I\\'m a manage a billing department in a big a/c company and I will definitely be looking professional with this shirt, Lmao)<br />It\\'s printed on a F.O.T.L Heavy HD shirt which is great since it\\'s a great quality fabric and one of the brands I use normally.<br />The print quality is high and<br />Will not break/Crack or get damaged as long as  it\\'s being washed properly.<br />Fits perfectly and fabric is nice and soft yet strong.<br />It\\'s a great shirt that get a lot of people looking 2-3 times to understand if it\\'s real or not ;-) I\\'m loving it.<br /><br />All in all its a great laugh and an awesome t-shirt that just ranked up in my favorite t-shirt list.<br />Seller was great and responsive, shipping was fast and packaging was OK.<br />Thank you Seller and Amazon for a superb service and product. I purchased this shirt for my son who is a college freshman.  He had a similar shirt a few years ago but it has now joined our rag bin because he wore it out!<br />The shirt arrived in perfect condition, well packaged in the appropriate size mailer. The shirt itself is very true to size and didn\\'t shrink after washing. The stitching is straight and secure and they print is very well done.  The quality overall is excellent.<br />The design of this shirt is much more detailed than the other one he wore so much.  When I gave him this one he loved it!  I\\'m very pleased with Fresh Tees Black and White Tuxedo with Bowtie shirt!<br />I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review I love the weight fo this shirt and the feel of it. Soft without being flimsy or see through.<br /><br />NICE!<br /><br />Going to buy the other one as well. This dress looks good in the picture. I ordered it and received a size larger than I requested. It is cheap and UGLY!!! You should take a better picture of this dress because it is NOT as appeared. Very unhappy. Will not order from you AGAIN!!!!!!!!! Very beautiful, and inexpensive, love them I received this tee shirt today. Shipping was pretty fast for not offering prime 2day. It fits as expected, and is a very nice soft cotton material. The screen print is even and looks to be of good quality. I habe washed it, but as I do with all of my screen print shirts I let them air dry. The color did not fade and the words look just as great as they did when it first arrived. I would highly recommend this shirt!<br />*i did receive this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion* This is a great quality shirt. The design was printed on a Fruit of a Loom Heavy duty shirt. The print itself looks to be very well done and solid. Of course like most printed shirts I am sure it will hold up longer if you turn it inside out before washing. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the x-large fit me as well as it did.<br /><br />I received this shirt at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I got this shirt for my sister who is getting married in September. The closer we get to her date, the more the shirt applies. I make her wear it every time we work together on the wedding. It\\'s printed really well on a good quality shirt. Not as soft as the shirts you\\'d get from Ript or anything, but it\\'s a nice sturdy shirt. I have no complaints about it.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. This ended up being a really cute gift for my BFF at her bridal shower. She\\'s going workout crazy, so she can wear it to the gym. i was so glad i could get it at a discounted rate I love this shirt! Very soft and well made. The colors in the design are bright and vibrant. It was a bit large on me, I ordered a large and definitely could have gone for a medium. Still very happy with it.<br /><br />I received a discount in exchange for a review. This ring is awesome! I am an avid coffee lover and think this ring fits me exactly. The ring is well made and doesnt bend easily. It is sterling silver so you will not turn green from wearing it. I bought it in a size 10 and it fits great on my thumb. The ring is true to size and very comfortable. If you are a coffee lover or know a coffee lover then this is the gift for them.<br />I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review. Are you a coffee drinker? Then this is the ring for you. A very clean and stylish ring that you will love, and will look wonderful on your hand . Ok this is a sterling silver with plating of rhodium. I have to jump on here real quick and give you my impressions of this product. I got it out of packaged in plastic. The box it comes in is cardboard. To me it could of been a little nicer of a box. I just reminds me of a discount store well known that sells jewelry. Now you can always find something else to present this in if it is a gift. I personally have been a lover of teas and coffees since my young teen years. I feel this fits my personality to the T. You will notice it is not a high setting ring. It sits very low to the hand. When you put this on there is a gap between the cup and steam. If you have to get a different size you could lightly and I mean lightly adjust it there. I wouldn\\'t adjust it unless last resort. I love it is good weight with out weighing out your hand. Many ways this could be worn on a index to middle finger. If you are wearing on one of those fingers maybe wear it higher on the knuckle. I will wear mine when doing photos of beauty and nail products. I feel now this can be a signature piece. I am getting used to the open but it is not bad. I would warn to take it off before you put on hose or anything thin that could tear. If it got a hold of something thin it could hook on and tear it. This would be a good starter piece of someone wearing jewelry for the first time. Maybe a preteen and you could tell them it is hot chocolate steaming. Below will be pictures of how I got it and on myself.<br />As an active blogger I received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own. I bought this for my mom who is an avid coffee drinker. She loved the ring! She thought it was adorable. It was great that it already came in a cute little gift box so that I could give it right to her. I bought it as thumb ring bought a half size too small but it ended up fitting her perfectly. So, I would say the ring runs just a tad bit on the large side. It is a good quality ring, the band isn\\'t too thin so it doesn\\'t bend easily. It is stamped 925 sterling silver. The design is cute and the quality is awesome. Win win! Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and is based solely on my experience with the product Unfortunately, I misplaced this ring and had to order a new one. I was pleasantly surprised when the new one arrived as it was more substantial than the first one. This felt less delicate (thankfully) and like I was getting great quality silver. Very nice ring. Looks modern and my friends love it. They want one too! This is a super cute coffee ring. It fits nicely . I ordered a size 7 and it fits true to size.  Very light weight and nicely made. Not bulky and a thin band which i like. Perfect for any gal that likes dainty rings like this one. It is stamped inside the ring of 925. It even comes in a very cute ring box as well to keep it in when not wearing it. I did receive this beautiful coffee ring discounted for my honest thoughts and unbiased review. I got this absolutely beautiful coffee ring for my best friend who is an avid coffee drinker and she loves it!!! It fits her to a T. The ring is very high quality sterling silver and and comes shipped in a cute little ring box. The ring is exactly what we expected and we are thrilled with our purchase. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I love, love, love coffee and now I love, love, love my coffee ring! It is a simple but so elegant design.  The coffee cup with steam coming off is so brilliant.  I love the shine from the high-quality 925 sterling and rhodium plating.  The ring has a nice weight.  It fits just right and looks so fashionable.  I wear it on my ring finger, but is also fits my middle finger.  A wonderful addition to my jewelry box.  I purchased this ring at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, and the thoughts in this review are my own. This is the cutest ring ever specially to all coffee lovers.  It fits perfect fit, very comfortable, and a big attention getter.  I have been approached by perfect strangers asking me where I got it and obviously I take them straight to it and show them.  This ring is made with the highest quality, beautifully castes, and no fear of green finger even with the heat of Texas my fingers were fine so you know is real sterling silver. Presentation of this ring is beautiful and makes a great gift to your coffee lovers. I received this product at a discount or gratuitous for my honest and unbiased review. This is the perfect coffee lover\\'s ring!! It is the perfect fit and very stylish.<br />The ring is sterling silver and very smooth. By far one of my favorite rings!<br />I highly recommend this for any coffee lover in your life!<br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. My daughter is a coffee lover so I got this ring for her. It comes packaged in a cute little white gift box complete with a bow. Ready for gift giving for any occasion.  The ring does not meet at the center -- there is a space between the coffee cup and the steam-- so it is adjustable. That is a great characteristic when purchasing for someone else. The ring is made of sterling silver and you can tell just by looking at it that it is the real deal. I tried it on and it does not cause any irritation to your fingers next to it like some rings do. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This little ring is absolutely adorable! I got this one for a friend who is a coffee fiend. It\\'s 925 Sterling Silver, so you know that the quality is great. I love the fact that the band is not so thin. You can tell that this ring is extremely well made. You could wear it yourself as a statement piece, or buy one for a friend or family member who is in love with their brew. It also comes in a nice little gift box all tied up in a white satin bow, so no wrapping is necessary. One unique presentation idea would be to &#34;bury&#34; the ring in a bag of great coffee and present it with a cute mug. Remember, now that school has started, the holidays are just around the corner so you may want to think about your gift list now. Note: I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. It\\'s really cute, but should be worn delicately, meaning not all the time.  It\\'s a thin sliver band and can bend easily, so it may snag and pull apart. If you are a coffee fan and love cute dainty rings, this is for you! If you get it and don\\'t like it, it can be returned within 30 days, so it\\'s a no risk purchase.  It comes in a cute little gift box and would be great as a stocking stuffer.  I received a ring at a special price for my honest review. I\\'m a huge coffee addict and love the stuff any way I can get it. Daniel Doughty\\'s sterling silver coffee cup ring is a beautiful way for me to show off my obsession!<br /><br />My fingers will react to cheap metal, so I try to watch what I\\'m wearing. This beautiful ring is made of 925 sterling silver and hasn\\'t caused my skin to react at all. The silver finish is very bright and the sterling silver is strong enough to resist bending or warping through the day. The thin band takes up very little space on my finger and is comfortable enough to wear all day!<br /><br />Of course I purchased this ring for its design moreso than its function. The tiny coffee cup and steam lines resemble the iconic image for coffee that every brew junkie is familiar with. The cup and detailed lines are separated completely and there\\'s a break in the ring in between them. The cup is wider than the band of the ring but not so much that it becomes a hassle.<br /><br />Daniel Doughty\\'s coffee ring is a gorgeous way to show my love for coffee! I did receive this ring at a discount but price doesn\\'t change how great it looks, nor does it effect my review. This is an adorable little ring to let everyone know how much you love your coffee!  Because of the separation between the mug and the steam, it will give enough for me to wear it on any of my fingers, not just the ring finger I ordered it in the size of. That\\'s cool.  It is sturdy and very well made and of a higher quality than rings I\\'ve purchased at a department store in the past.  The steam part does stick out a little and it might snag on things, so I\\'m saving this pretty ring for date night or going out to the coffee shop with my mom friends.  It\\'s just too nice to wear on laundry day!!  It is dainty, the cup not much wider than my finger.  It\\'s a sweet little ring that shows that you have a quirky side and appreciate a cup of tea or a mug of coffee.  I\\'d definitely buy it for any barista or aspiring novelist or grad student.  I did receive a discount in exchange for this honest, unbiased review.  I would certainly buy this again for a friend.  I think it is very pretty.  : ) I LOVE this ring! Well, I love coffee, so it just follows. But also, it\\'s well made, has a classy look, and is made of sterling silver. There\\'s no downside here.<br /><br />First, it\\'s adorable. Who wouldn\\'t love this little homage to my favorite morning beverage? And, yes, it\\'s a coffee ring, but I bet if you know someone who loves a nice cup of hot tea, she\\'d like this, too.<br /><br />The ring functions a little like an adjustable ring, since it\\'s open on the one side. I was a little hesitant about what size to order - so I erred on the large size, hoping it wouldn\\'t matter. It turned out to be a perfect decision -- the ring slips easily over my knuckles, and then I can squeeze it down to a comfortable level of snugness.<br /><br />It\\'s also, well, just very nice looking, even thought it\\'s fun. I would be completely comfortable wearing this to a business meeting. It\\'s a piece of casual jewelry, but so well made I think it can work with many ensembles.<br /><br />The &#34;steam&#34; does protrude a bit. I found it catching on various things until I got used to it.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review. Any opinion expressed is mine alone. I love this coffee ring! Itâ€™s so cute and so â€œme;â€\\x9d I love coffee and silver jewelry! The ring fit nicely, true to size and since there is a gap between the top of the cup and the steam, it can be gently adjusted if necessary.<br />The one thing that keeps this from being an everyday ring for me is that gap between the cup and steam; it seems to keep getting caught on my hair. Cute for a few hours at a time, though :)<br />*Product received at a discount in exchange for honest review* Perfect everything was as expected A really nice shirt for the money!  I am buying another one.  Feels like a football jersey. Very comfortable for a starter and, doesn\\'t hurt. I want a refugmnd for the belts I have bought this item for my wife since she likes wearing casual clothes. She loved it. I love this dress! Wore it to a wedding! Fits as expected, love the color. My bust is 40 1/2  and the extra large measurement was 39 1/2 ( give or take). So I ordered a size up( XXL) even though reviews said it was stretchy, because I still wanted a modest, not too tight fit. Well, I could have ordered the XL, there is enough stretch in the fabric to give an inch or so without looking tight.  Since I ordered up, I\\'ll just take it in at the zipper, no problem.  The fabric quality is great. Not so heavy that a crinoline won\\'t hold it out but not flimsy either.  It\\'s  true to color( i ordered the blue/violet and its a nice deep purple) I\\'m  5\\'4&#34; and the Xxl hits me almost mid calf ( without petticoat)  shipping was fast and came two days before it was scheduled to. Beautiful color, nice look, runs 2 sizes to small.ðŸ˜\\xad Excellent! Worth every penny. The perfect dress if you are pear shaped and/or bottom heavy and don\\'t want to wear the shorter dresses that are in style these days. Very feminine and lady like. After ordering pants from Mountain Warehouse which were a perfect fit and excellent quality, I was confident ordering a few other products from them. The package arrived in a few days but with the wrong items. Here\\'s where the company shines. I emailed them that night and the next morning I received an email apologizing and assuring me the correct items were being sent immediately and they would reimburse return shipping costs. The items arrived the next day as well as confirmation of reimbursed shipping fee.  This jacket is actually a higher quality and craftsmanship than I expected. The fit is roomy which I need for layering. Details such as velcro closures along zipper and hood are well placed, two discrete inner pockets are perfect for phone, wallet, sunglasses, keys. I love the overall quality and the color is perfect. I look forward to future purchases from Mountain Warehouse. I am writing to share a serious matter of importance as it relates to one of your childrenâ€™s costumes.  I refer to your Gone Mental childrenâ€™s costume, with the description that reads, â€œHe has crazy thoughts in his headÂ¡Â\\xadheÂ¡Â¯s GONE MENTAL. This pullover tunic features faux vinyl straightjacket straps with buckles detailing, blood splatters, and mental ward screen print. YouÂ¡Â¯d be crazy not to get one!â€\\x9d My younger daughter, once an honor student, athlete and musician before her illness presented during the onset of adolescence, has lived with schizoaffective disorder for the past six years, and was hospitalized as a child.  Weâ€™ve taken her to UCLA and Stanford, as well as our local hospitals, hoping to make sense of her devastating illness.  If you have ever spent anytime visiting a loved one in a childrenâ€™s/adolescentâ€™s mental health treatment facility, I assure you, you would understand that this costume is painfully cruel. Childhood suffering is not an appropriate inspiration for a Halloween costume.  And neither is adulthood suffering (note that you sell several other adult costumes that stigmatize and inappropriately portray the mentally ill). Vampires are not real.  Mummies come-to-life, monsters and zombies are not real.  Cartoon characters, fairy princesses and action heroes are not real.  Those types of costumes are appropriate to sell for children for Halloween.  But childhood and adolescent mental illness very real.  I doubt you would sell a Stage Four Cancer costume.  Why would you sell a costume that makes fun of a severe brain disorder? Stigma only encourages hopelessness and despair.  Please reconsider stigmatizing our daughterâ€™s very real illness by removing â€œGone Mentalâ€\\x9d and other mental illness inspired costumes from your inventory. I love the green color and the fact that it is waterproof instead of water resistant . It is a lightweight fabric and reminds me of the pack-a-ble jackets. the sleeves are a tad too long, but that is because I ordered a size larger then normal since I like to layer in colder weather. Great product! Overall they fit ok.  They are tight through my thighs, but loose around my waist.  They are also a little shorter than expected (hit right above my knees and I\\'m 5\\'5&#34;) Overall the front is the same as the back and without a tag, I tried them on both ways.  It felt tight going over my backside, but had extra fabric in the front.  Overall they did what they were supposed to with excess sweating during my workout, but not the most comfortable fitting workout pants I own and had to readjust here and there. I ordered a medium for my daughter and it fits great! She loves it. She plans to wear it in the cooler weather with a jean jacket too.<br />Super cute! I received this purchase at a discount price in exchange for my honest review. It is the cheapest shirt I have ever bought. Totally disappointed. These are really high-rise and short I\\'m 5\\'10 these are at least 2 inches short. They are stretchy but the cut it terrible!! Would not recommend!! I bought 2xl t shirts. They are comfortable and fit the way I expected. They were shipped sooner the the original estimated date and arrived in good condition. Nice outfit just too small. I thought Trump was supposed to stand for quality. Wrong!!  Not worth the price. Cheap, Cheap, Cheap.  Bought 3 ties, none are even the same length. Just got this today and I love it. It fits perfect!! Stitching and pattern DON\\'T line up with the neckline....VERY noticeable that it\\'s off center and it looks REALLY BAD!! Returning it! Very cute. Good quality The product is okay. This is the 2nd belt I have had to replace because it split. I am average size. Belts are not quality product. [[VIDEOID:53b2db124969d55f8671f24e58b2352]] UPDATE: This takes a learning curve to get used to. The lever that releases the pin from the teeth require that you push it in a certain direction to release it. I thought my belt was stuck, but instead of forcing it, I simply inhaled a little (to take pressure off of the belt) and that allowed me to easily push the lever and release the belt. Note that you don\\'t want a belt that releases *too* easily, which I have experienced especially with the Bowen knife belts. (those randomly pop off, which drives me crazy)<br /><br />UPDATE x2: Dang I just saw the price on this. I\\'m blown away by Amazon. This is a very high quality leather belt for the price. I\\'m a cheap skate, and I can tell you my humble minions... this would cost twice at Nordstrom.<br /><br />âœ\\x8fï¸\\x8f Quick thoughts to supplement my video demonstration.<br /><br />I like this belt because:<br />- The nylon is nice because it\\'s somewhat \\\\\\\\\"floppy\\\\\\\\\" and isn\\'t stiff like conventional leather. Granted it has the military type look (rather than the nicely dressed look that you\\'d associate with a leather belt), but the nylon is extremely durable and heavy duty and doesn\\'t scratch up like leather. Awesome military belt if you\\'re looking for one to hang a 45 off of.<br />- Super customization. The little notches allow me to fit it perfectly around my waste, as opposed to conventional belts that have set holes, which can be upwards of two inches apart.<br />- Looks awesome. Cool seeing a belt with no holes.<br />- Easy to put on. Stays in place and doesn\\'t slip.<br />- Easy to take off, once you get the hang of it (see update above). Note: Do NOT force it! It\\'ll just dig the \\\\\\\\\"teeth\\\\\\\\\" MORE into the mechanism, and you\\'ll be stuck. Just take your time, and it\\'ll come right off.<br />- True to sizing. Don\\'t try to go \\\\\\\\\"a size up\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\"a size down\\\\\\\\\" from you pants.<br /><br />Note: I was given a sample of this product in exchange for a review and demonstration.<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br /><br />ðŸ“\\x8d Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?<br />ðŸ‘\\x8d Yes, absolutely.br /><br />ðŸ“\\x8d Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?<br />ðŸ‘\\x8d Yes, absolutely. I wear lots of sweaters/sweatshirts/hoodies, because I tend to be cold a lot, and I like to layer.  Plus, I live in the Northeast, so warm clothes are a must!<br /><br />I chose this hoodie in purple, and I love the color.  It is a beautiful vibrant purple and it is just what I wanted.<br /><br />The fabric is unlike any hoodie I have had before.  The thermal material is just like you would expect - that sort of thin, waffle-like material that you would find with something like thermal bottoms.<br /><br />I put that the fit was somewhat small, because this has a slim, tight fit.  I chose size medium, and I am 5\\'7&#34; and about 125lbs, and the hoodie is not loose on me.  I usually wear a size 8, which is why I chose size M.  I am happy with the fit as it has a nice look to it, compared to some of my baggier, more casual hoodies.  Also this is sort of long on the torso and the sleeves, which I like, as tops are often too short on me.<br /><br />It does have a zipper, pockets (which even fit my iPhone 6, which is nice!) and a hood with drawstring.<br /><br />This is perfect for end-of-summer mornings and evenings, as the crisp fall weather is starting to move in, and good for year round when you need some extra warmth.  Overall a cute hoodie!<br /><br />I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review. My 3 year old loves these! I love it Great quality for the price and fits true to size. I ordered a Medium and I\\'m a size 8 usually. Quality was good. I LOVE this dress, very comfortable and received lots of complements from coworkers. The dress has a high waste (just under the bra line) ,ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘\\x8d Too large needed to return it Good basic workout attire, not noticeablely cooling, according to my wife These were way to small and had a chemical smell! : ( I to these on a whim thinking they would be great for my workouts, While they seem well made they are cut extremely small, I normally wear a 3-4 in Jr I got the small they are too small,  I would recommend if you decide to purchase these go a size up. They get 2 stars for the price.  I typically wear a large, but I ordered the extra large because I was unfamiliar with the brand, glad I did.  After about 2 hours of wearing these strings were already unraveling in the seams.  The seams do not seem to be reinforced.  Poor quality, will only wear around the house now and with the way the seams are deteriorating it doesn\\'t look like I will be doing that for very long. My wife loves it. Very comfortable for exercise and breathes well on the skin. This is my 3rd Rothco boonie. All fit true to size and all great quality. This midnight camo color is unique. I\\'ll buy more if these wear out! I just had major surgery & have hypersensitive skin. I purchased this & my doctor allowed me to wear during the surgery & post surgery. Everyone from the anesthesiologist, all my nurses in the OR & in patient floor nurses were raving about how nice it was and that the hospital needed more gowns like this!! I love it!! It does run a tad small. But I\\'d order these in every pattern available!! As described, love it Was excited to get this shirt, but the problems started early. First, it was shipped to the wrong address. Second, the image looks iron-on with a large yellow box around the graphic. They assure me they don\\'t iron-on; I\\'m skeptical. Third, it began to wear out with holes appearing, stitching coming loose after only a few months. They offered me 20% off another $40 shirt (I got a long-sleeve) as amends. Not happy, wish I had the cool shirt I wanted. I love you Qwel. I take a size 6 I bought large still to small ? For the price is like a gift and and you have two sets in one...!!!! Seriously such an amazing set, comes with everything you need and is super affordable for the items that come with it. I definitely recommend this :) Very cute! I ordered it in blue and I love it. Also ships quickly. Very, very comfortable, padded wire free bra top. Off the shoulder lace gives it a sexy look, while the padding offers coverage. The super stretchy material moves and stretches with your body. The lace is also very stretchy and soft. I found the padding a little too much for me. It is a round pad directly in the center. It is a bit thicker than I usually wear, but offered excellent coverage. The off the shoulder lace, would be better if it was on the shoulder, I feel that it would be even more supportive that way. I love the no wire. I hate wearing wires, they are extremely uncomfortable for me. I got this with the intention of wearing it under a couple dresses that need a little extra coverage than a regular bra offers. It is extremely comfortable, and is a nice addition to my lingerie drawer.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. Opinions are my own. I LOVE THIS SHIRT! Washed it(didn\\'t shrink!) and wore it 3x already! I ordered this in red plaid and it\\'s way better quality than I expected! It\\'s a good quality flannel type material. I ordered 2 sizes bigger per other reviews and it fits perfect. I was concerned about the shipping time as it ships from China but I received it in a discreet package in 9 days! Great purchase for my honeymoon! fits well, nice color, but has 2 stains that did not wash out....very disappointed. would gladly accept another shirt Excellent product and price....made out of 50 cotton 50 poly so shrinkage is not an issue.  Shipping was fast.  I ordered another hoodie from same seller with different design and I\\'m just as pleased.  Would definitely buy again!'"

Five Stars Not only were they very nice people, their coffee was the best One Star A convenient and hearty meal Matcha Powder Three Stars Awesome Five Stars Love this tea Arrived as expected. One Star It\\'s savory and sweet and nice and crunchy As a family allergic to wheat, dairy, eggs, nuts, and several other things, we love the entire Cravings Place line of products as it allows us to bake treats with minimal effort and ingredients. Most allergy-free and gluten-free mixes usually just omit one or two allergens at most, so it\\'s great to see a mix created without many of the most common allergens. (Note these still have soy and corn). We consume these on a regular basis and have been doing so for years. My favorite nut.  Creamy, crunchy, salty, and slightly sweet - what more could you ask for? This green tea tastes so good! My girlfriend loves it too. I love Melissa\\'s brand but this is a great second when I can\\'t get Melissa\\'s brand. good The popcorn was stale. Love these bars, but have to watch out for the fat and sugar grams Love the taste but the price was too high and it doesn\\'t come in a 6 or 12 pack. I\\'m a member of the crowdtap jif program and jif sent me a sample of its jif bars to try and review and my family and I loved them!great peanut butter taste and so easy to take with you whenever you need a great snack! Used to be a decent product.  Disgusting now and difficult on digestion.  All 3 purchased from Costco over past couple months end in same result -- open the container and it smells like rancid oil.  Something not right about how they are making/processing this powder now.  Will not buy again. I cannot tell the difference in taste between soy sauce and these Bragg Liquid Aminos. I\\'m glad I bought the small spray bottle of it so that I can have better control of how much I use as it is powerful stuff! Since I\\'m watching my sodium intake I like to make my own stir-fry dishes and can still enjoy that &#34;soy sauce&#34; flavor enhancer without overdoing it. It\\'s pretty good also on a home cooked burger and beef steak - slather melted butter on top of the cooked meat before serving, give it a quick spray of aminos, a few grinds of black pepper....... and enjoy! Good flavor and seems concentrate enough to add a little more sweet that the other one I have. Great to use in recipes. It\\'s rice. Have enough to last for months. Very good tasting and a great way to get away from the sugar. They were perfect and came right on time Wow, these are sooooooo good and I am not a sweet tooth.  So full of nuts and very addicting! I bought this from a local super market on a whim and decided to let people know how it tastes. I\\'m a huge fan of peanut butter and salted caramel.<br /><br />For instance, I had a Salted Caramel and Almond Kind Bar today and it was amazing. It tasted like you would expect it to taste.<br /><br />However, this particular product tastes like a chemical spill. It starts off with a peanut butter taste, but then the (caramel I\\'m guessing) tastes kind of burnt and chemical-like, and then it finishes with a very salty burnt taste.<br /><br />I had some on a spoon and disliked it, then I put some on pretzel bread and it was slightly palatable, but overall I would avoid this product as it doesn\\'t really taste like salted caramel peanut butter.<br /><br />Just for fun, I let my co-workers taste it and only 1 out of 5 of them thought that this product tasted &#34;okay&#34;. The rest of them shared my sentiment. I love this tea, it\\'s delicious and since it is cool brew I don\\'t have to put on a kettle or boil water them waste ice trying to cool down my tea for summer time. Also, when I\\'m on the go, I can stick a bag into a water bottle I get out of the refrigerator and go out the door. I have used servo different brands of coconut oil and this is by the best! It wasn\\'t gritty like most and very smooth. I really like that you can subscribe to purchase it monthly. One thing I know that is a little bit of coconut oil goes a long way! We use coconut oil for lotion and also for our dog. It has many uses and I enjoy this brand best! Definitely will purchase it again and again! Taste as remembered like them a lot LOVE THIS STUFF This is a variety of candy for halloween to hand out. The kids love it! Just need to buy at least 2-3 bags because one won\\'t be enough for all the kids especially in my neighborhood. There are a lot of children that go trick or treating with their parents. not craze about these. nothing really wrong with them just no into them. These crackers are small so not much room for cheese. We love it. It gives our favorite salads a taste of Bavaria. A very large bottle.  I got it to make Coronarita\\'s, and it was great. it\\'s gum.. It works well for nagging sensations in the stomach. Good dark roast flavor. Absolutely love these coffee samples. I don\\'t know what kind of water these people drink but it tastes exactly like water lol it\\'s a no brainier , and I read review saying it is bad for thyroid , what?? Please explain that!!!!! Good choice! Never will buy any other tomato product again. CIRIO are the best tomato product I\\'ve used. I love pringles. The original one\\'s my favorite. These snack-sized pringles are perfect! An Australian friend acquainted me with Vegemite 30 years ago.  Now I can get it on Amazon.  It tastes as great as ever on a toasted muffin or a bagel. The flavor did remind me of Korean Bulgogi, but not in a good way. These are just ok, nothing great. Soon to tell, but this wheat grass, so far, hasn\\'t upset my stomach like another brand.  This product is gluten free, and organic--must haves for me.  Arrived as promised.  I trust this brand. Really hot for wasabi There are no instructions to say to make sure it is lined up properly with your machine or it will make holes in the bottom mesh.  I learned after holes appeared. LifeSavers brand has been around for a long, long time.  I can remember that when I was just a kid my Grandfather always carried either a roll of the Wint-O-Green or Peppermint LifeSavers in one of his business suit fob pockets.  If he knew I would be visiting him and Gram at the farm, he\\'d hide a roll of the fruit flavored LifeSavers in one of the small chest pockets of his bib overalls for me to find.  What a treat!  To this day, when I eat any one of these mints, fond memories of my Grandfather and good times at the farm come flooding back.  The mints have a long lasting flavor that leaves my mouth feeling fresh and cool. I buy these large bags at Walmart all the time for six dollars ninety eight a bag so not too sure why they are so pricey here. This product is beautifully labelled. That\\'s about all there is to it. The actual taste is not consistent with the flavor the label claims to represent. Just a very pretty bottle. The good news is that the failure of this product to meet my expectation served as the impetus for me to make my own syrups. Real fruit juice + Sugar Ok but not enough BBQ flavor Excellent taste, very soft It came in perfect condition! My kids and I are completely obsessed with cotton candy, however the majority of the cotton candy on the market is NOT organic, so when I discovered this organic cotton candy from Spun Paradise Cotton Candy Co., I knew that we had to give it a try...imagine, delicious flavored cotton candy, but organic! Hooray!<br /><br />My cotton candy package arrived quickly to my home and was in perfect condition in the very nice plastic containers. I am always iffy about ordering food through the mail, however, this cotton candy was perfect, not melted or damaged in any way. We ordered 4 different flavors, and had to immediately try each and every one. The watermelon quite tasty and didn\\'t taste artificial at all, but yummy and very true to flavor. I also found that this cotton candy doesn\\'t just melt away like typical cheapie cotton candy tends to. It melts nicely in the mouth and is absolutely delicious. I will never ever ever go back to the average run of the mill cotton candy and will definitely be repurchasing from Spun Paradise in the future!!<br /><br />I received this product at no cost to me and have provided my honest and unbiased review in return. Great product This is the only instant coffee I drink. Good flavor, a little less acid to make my tummy happy. I\\'ve been drinking this for over 10 years, it tastes almost as good as regular brewed coffee. I am disappointed in this coffee. It has very little flavor and I have to use the strong brewing setting on my Bunn My Café to get the little taste there is.  I try to always by organic but this is really a waste of my money. This tea is great.  I enjoyed each flavor. This is my go-to tea for cold winter nights! husband likes It might take me &#34;forever&#34; to use this bag but it tastes GREAT! It has more of a &#34;peppery like&#34; taste compared to cinnamon that you buy in the store and is not as sweet. much cheaper in the grocery store, and the organic brand is not much better tasting! Great!  I have to import this to any area in the country where I am living that doesn\\'t carry it and I think that\\'s most of the US. Love this stuff! Great product as usual.  The mint has a stronger bite, not as subtle as others, but that\\'s my preference. Used it on my son\\'s birthday cake easy to use hardly any taste Delicious, smooth, bitter free coffee. Just okay Perfect and easy healthy soup mix What can I say, these are so yummy you can\\'t stop eating them!  :) Very delicious. Will be getting more in the future. Super!!!!! Love this coffee This is really good coconut oil. I use it to cook with and as a supplement to my diet. It is also very good for blemishes. Great coffee WHAT A GREAT MUSTARD, JUST LIKE IT SAYS ITS SWEET AND A LITTLE HOT I\\'m not a fan of pies and sweets but these are yummy! I always eat one on my cheat day. Finally, I found an all-natural way to dye my hair. Glad to use it. I was expecting &#34;southern&#34; sweetness from this tea. It doesn\\'t t live up to that southern descriptor in my opinion. However, it is a very good tea and if u add a little sweeter, you\\'re golden. Peanut bars arrived promptly and were delicious and fresh. great product, great value! These are really delish. They don\\'t just taste like sugar; they have real flavor. But I had to deduct two stars for:<br />1. The artificial sweetener used upsets my stomach (not Splenda, the other sweetener they use)<br />2. These are WAY too expensive. Don\\'t think I\\'ll be ordering again unless the price comes down. Great coffee! Who knew you could enjoy an energy drink for breakfast? I received this product to try and review from bzzagent.com. I love the taste of this V8 V-Fusion +Energy. You can taste both the peach and the mango and the combination is delicious. It is not as sweet as fruit juice. The drink contains 50% juice, and and also green tea. There is no added sugar which is a selling point for me as my fiance has diabetes and I try to watch my sugar intake as well. There is a mild amount of caffeine in the drink which I prefer as too much caffeine makes me jittery. V8 V-Fusion +Energy has just enough to get you through a busy morning. I would definitely recommend it. My personal favorite Great product!  Arrived on time~ I have used Kaffree Roma for many years now and when my regular store stopped carrying it, guess where I finally found it, of course at Amazon.  Thank you Amazon.  I can\\'t drink regular coffee because of a health problem but this product tastes as close to regular coffee as you can get.  It is a great substitute for regular coffee and I highly recommend it. It was good.  I\\'ve had it many times before dented capsules Im a choosie Mother, and I choose Jif  Granola Bars! They are sooooo good, my favorite is the Chocolate one.Its chocolaty, cruncchy nutty peanut buttery.I lovem and so did the Kids.I received as a Criwdtapper  for unbiased teview The glazed fruits pieces are colorful and pieces distinct, not clumped together. Turns out really nice and taste good in my fruitcake. Love this product. It sweetens without any after taste. I loves these because you need very little to have the flavor. These are tangy and usually soft enough to almost be &#34;stewed&#34; the way my mamma used to serve them.  My husband and I each enjoy 2 or 3 each evening as a dessert. My absolute favorite! Best price I have found! These are fantastic. Tons of flavor, and you\\'ll never miss the sodium. Gonna bu more Lovely taste and came packaged very well. Just as advertised. Candy was about the same as the other coffee candy I\\'ve bought.  Was good but not outstanding. Fast shipping and good product. I have purchased ceremonial grade matcha from three different vendors and this was by far the best of the three.  It isn\\'t bitter and it has a smooth mouth feel. Delicious I needed more fiber in my diet and decided to try these Fiber One Oats and Chocolate Bars. They satisify my need for fiber and my love of chocolate.<br /><br />Each bar is 1.4 ounces and provides 35% of your daily fiber. They have 4g of fat per bar. These bars are made by General Mills. The bars are chewy and a little crunchy. They are naturally flavored. Some of the ingredients in the bar are semisweet chocolate chips, whole grain oats, barley flakes, sugarcane fiber, soy lecithin and milk.<br /><br />This is a great value for this hard cardboard box. This is the price that I would get if I went to Sam\\'s Club. These bars are regularly sold in vending machines and at convenience stores. They are great snacks, for the kids in-between meals, to take on the run, to take on vacations or anytime you want something healthy to eat on the go.<br /><br />I was very pleased with these bars and I continue to purchase them. Like most working moms, I can\\'t pump enough to feed my baby exclusively breast milk. For these formulas, I preferred the gentle version to the soothe version for our son. Overall, these aren\\'t my favorite formulas. I felt like they caused more intestinal issues than other formulas. (I\\'m still stymied why many formulas, like the soothe version, use complex sugars when babies should be getting most of their sugars in a simple form, like they do in breast milk. I know it\\'s probably cheaper for the company, but I\\'d prefer to pay more and have a formulation closer to breast milk. But this is just my opinion, and this may work very well for lots of people.) Love it! Not what I expected.  Did not like it at all. I LOVE cheese puffs and these are the very best!  Bought them in a hotel snack shop in Vegas.  Came home, found them on Amazon and now buy them by the case.  They are as close as I come to &#34;junk food&#34; and they don\\'t even qualify.  Great, all natural ingredients.  I never tire of them. My grandkids love them too. GREAT!  Thanks So much and God bless!  &#60;&#62;&#60; the best- and good price. Yummy, one of my faves.  Highly recommend. Fresh and good.  Quick delivery. The candy coating is thick. This coffee is really great!  I like the fact that they don\\'t use the plastic cups that are so bad for the environment.  It\\'s a really great price as well. Just what I expected and much healthier than Splenda, Equal or Sweet and Low. Great tasting...easy to open and close packaging...priced right. High quality tea bags. Played the Bean Boozled game with my 9 year old daughter and it was so much fun! The packages are smaller than I expected, but the contents are enough to play a game. Or, you can just enjoy the yummy and NOT so yummy jelly beans on your own. However, beware of the dog food... Gag! AAAAAAAAAAA Yummy! Great price and yummy product. Thankfully it is a prime item. When this first arrived I thought, what, only this much?  It is a small quantity, but that is because the powder is only needed in very small quantities (1 teaspoon gives you &#62;1000 percent of your vitamin C for the day!).  Doesn\\'t really taste like anything I can tell but is a nutritional superfood.  Good value compared to the local grocery.  Will buy again.  Came fast and free with Amazon Prime. Tasty Fruit was not as distinct or sharp compared to others I have had. Good taste I like it. This is my husband\\'s favorite flavor.  We cannot find it in any local stores.  So I ordered a big package that I hope will last a while. I add this to my beef gravy to make it taste great. I love grape Powerade. The taste reminds me of grape koolaid, just a little more refined. quick delivery, excellant quality(fresh) The regular Lattes from Gevalia are better, but they\\'re typically more expensive on Amazon. The flavor is fine...little weak Tasty, but not suitable for diabetics. All good!! These are great for dry mouth. I have been using them for years and I love them. Loved these! Deep, intense, old-fashioned flavor I remembered from my youth. Total satisfaction, will be ordering again. Nice Set;  I gave this as a gift and she seemed very happy with it. This was an ok cleanse.  A few of the favors were almost unbearable.  I had to chug them with my fingers holding my nose closed which then made my stomach sick.  Probably won\\'t use this one again, but I did feel much better after there days.  I couldn\\'t do the full 5 and I wasted my money :( These Indulgio K Cups are soooo good!  I\\'ve tried all of them I think, and I love them all!  Pumpkin is my favorite as it reminds me of a pumpkin spice latte from S\\'bucks.  Not too bad on calories either, about 70 each I think.<br />I\\'ve tried other brands, but these are the best in my opinion!  They taste very fresh and authentic! Delicious Instant relief great tasting!! This cocoa was so much better than the other three we tested I was moved to review it.  It mixes well in hot and cold liquids.  Has a nice rich flavor.  Will be buying it again. Good decaf = strong taste without the caffeine kick we use these too. see previous reviews  also gave these as birthday presents. Great product, great price, great shipping! I\\'m writing this review because, making a decision with the family wallet this time, my last S&S order included a well-known brand of canned pineapple (chunks, not organic). Yes, the case was more than 3x cheaper than  my other Pineapple order before that, this Native Forest Organic Crushed Pineapple. Simply put, even the difference in color gave it all away... The cheaper brand has virtually no color or flavor, whereas Native Forest offers sweet, beautiful pineapple that you want to gobble up (and do!) much too quickly! I\\'m sorry,  but I just can\\'t afford this luscious canned fruit like I would like!! Anyway, while it was in the house, I basically enjoyed the organic crushed pineapple in smoothies, and also as a Pina colada-esque treat with coconut milk and/or unsulphured and unsweetened shredded coconut. Highly recommended! I received the plants earlier today and they are wonderful! One of them already has a pup and some are recently plucked pups! My only problem is that 2 of them are dead- the caput medusa and the argentea. I hope the company will replace them for me! Good variety, family loves the flavors. Coffee has a great smell and a decent taste. Pleased with this purchase. Wow, this is very good Beef Jerky!! One of my relatives is a professional beach volleyball player &amp; she left a package at our home. I ate some and I found it to be excellent. Too good. I can eat a whole bag at one sitting.  Will buy around the holidays to have delicious gluten free cookies but otherwise I would gain 50 if I just had them lying around. It\\'s a great flour - but caution it is whole wheat and dense! So if you\\'re trying to make a soft bread - this is not the flour for you unless you mix it with another flour and make a wheat/white bread. I used only this flour in my bread machine and followed the recipe for raisin bread but the end result was the bread was dense and heavy. It was still very good but it was almost like a dense German bread or an Ezekiel bread. If you like that kind of texture then this is definitely the flour for you but I like my bread soft and pliable and hence from now onwards I will definitely mix this flour with another flour to make my bread. I prefer the molino grassi organic flour if you\\'re looking for an Italian flour that makes delicious bread that doesn\\'t give you a gluten/wheat reaction. I couldn\\'t eat bread for years and now with these Italian flours I can finally eat bread! Yay! love I love these bars but lately they\\'ve been growing bacteria and making the packages ballon up. Last time about 1/3 of the box was bad, today I opened a new one and 10 out of 12 bars are bad. Not sure what\\'s going on here but I\\'ll change my review once they address this issue.  Update: They\\'ve fixed the packaging problem apparently. Back to ordering these. I first discovered Blue Chips on a Jet Blue flight and told myself I needed to get more of them. I got 4 boxes. My family and I were not disappointed. Yummy My absolute favorite brand of candy. Perfectly chewy and sour. I wasn\\'t looking for organic honey, so this was perfect for my homemade salves/body wash I made with it. I can\\'t personally speak to the taste since I didn\\'t eat it, but husband said it was the best honey he had tasted. As an ingredient in body washes/soaps/facial cleansers, it spreads easily and is just the right consistency without being impossible to combine with other ingredients without heating. And, for 3 lbs, you can\\'t beat the price. While a glass jar would have been neat (I would\\'ve saved it and used it for later), for the price this product was perfect. LOVE IT The product had too much sugar in it.  It was good but the sugar amount is too high. These use to be the best tasting bars on the market; I had one for breakfast for a good part of 5 years. But Powerbar changed the formula or something and now they are just awful. Additionally they were 2.29-Ounce but the new packaging has them at 1.58-Ounce Bars. I switched to Cliff bars. Convenient and economical if you\\'re a Spam fan, as is my husband. Excellent product; spice blend tastes delicious! I buy every thing this company makes and love them. This was low on fruit, high on syrup. Not worth the monry. This is the only 100% full fat coconut milk we can find.  Thank you to Aroy-D for keeping their product as pure as possible & thank Amazon for carrying it.  Life saver for those on severely restricted diets like GAPS & FOD-MAP diets, especially those like me unable to eat many of the animal based fats including dairy, but who still need lots of fat!  I love to make smoothies or ice cream using this stuff: 1 cup AROY-D, 1 egg yoke, 1/2 to 1 whole banana, puree using wand blender.  You can either drink it this way, or let it sit in freezer for 3-5 hours to make &#34;ice cream&#34;.  Add soaked & dried nuts that are tolerable (for me only macademia nuts) & small chunks of fruit (my favorite right now as I was able to add it back into diet recently is fresh or frozen blueberries!). These dates were very old upon arrival, and for the most part dry and tasteless. No where on the packaging dos it state they are organic. Don\\'t be fooled by the great price! Love it! Always good to have a taste from home and if you\\'re an Aussie you need this in your pantry! Use instead of shortening when baking treats.  I like to cook \\'sweet\\' items with virgin coconut oil.  You don\\'t notice the coconut flavor in sweets.  I don\\'t like virgin coconut oil in savory dishes however...If cooking savory dishes like fried rice I prefer refined coconut oil.  Coconut oil is guilt free good for you oil  The virgin oil has more healthy properties so I use it whenever possible. Great price! This is my absolute favorite coffee. It\\'s smooth and a perfect medium. I wish I could get 3 packages in the whole bean for the same price from this seller. Great taste! These are the best pancakes ever!! good stuff and good taste.  very helpful in controlling gerd. Boner juice. Have tried all cookie flavors and enjoy them all. Good product. Expensive. I noticed the words 1g Sugar and bought this on the spot at a health food store, believing it was just low sugar but after reading the ingredients at home, I had to drive a long way to return it because it had sucralose in it. With sucralose, this is not a health bar. It is on the same level as nutrasweet and causes severe reactions in some people including myself. There is nothing healthy about sucralose. Stevia is a very healthy and great tasting alternative and natural sweetener but extremely hard to find in current products and if the so-called health food companies would just use it, then it could be called healthy. Also, Saccharin is a very good sweetener that has been given a bad rap for years by the FDA for supposedly causing cancer but has never been proven. I have used &#34;Sweet & Low&#34; daily for over 35 years in my coffee, tea, cereal, etc. and have had virtually no reactions ever and am cancer free! Other countries don\\'t want America\\'s health foods because of the awful, unhealthy ingredients. The FDA should demand that products containing splenda and nutrasweet have bold lettering on the package warning consumers. Shame on atkins. Thanks I purchased the large 32 count package to try.  This has been a great benefit to me. I substitute it for a meal because I live alone and sometimes just do not want a heavy meal. This nutrition shake has about 25 percent of most daily nutrients per drink, so that is good; it is glutin free, contains soy instead of milk products.  The packaging sort of turned me off at first but I grew to like it because it takes little space in the refrigerator, is compact for storage, easy to dispose of when finished.  The straw is a little difficult at times to access and lengthen (has a slide out feature) but once that is done, it is easy to insert into the top foil slot.  The 32 count is a bit heavy for me to lift as a full package, though.  It is 130 calories per shake and is very satisfying.  I like it for breakfast or as an afternoon snack.  I am going to keep these shakes on hand because they really are good as a supplement and meal substitute. I received this for a discount rate in exchange for my honest review. I am trying to stop using regular sugar and this is the perfect alternative I have to get used to only needing a little to make it sweet enough Much better value than buying in the grocery store!! My favorite chai tea.  With a packet of stevia this is sublime. This does not have milk or cream substitutes, it is plain tea flavored chai.  Add your own milk and sweetner, this is just the tea. Es puro azucar, no tiene sabor a cas. I don\\'t know about you, but shopping with my toddler can be an absolute nightmare. These work great as a bribery tool..don\\'t judge..a mom has gotta do what a mom has gotta do! I keep a few of these in my diaper bag at all times to prevent a melt down if necessary. They came perfectly packed and in great condition. I highly recommend! It was delivered sooner than I thought it would be. Thank You !!!  The product &#34;Carrie Anne\\'s Muscadine Jam is wonderful. Taste just like I remembered it to taste when I was a kid. I have not had Muscadine Jam since I was about  11 years old, ( I am not 70 years old ), when my family moved up to Indiana at that time. As you know we do not have the Muscadine berries or some call them grapes up north here.  Thanks for offering this wonderful item for us to order.  jazzurfonics@aol.com I love this, wish it came in a larger size.  It\\'s sealed and has a resealable package to keep the coffee pods fresh.  Plus, they are eco friendly. Delicious and potent. Love the smell of fresh roasted coffee in the morning. Cafe Don Pablo gets my day started!!! This product is simply amazing. I was skeptical at first. How could a pill change the way we perceive things? But dang, this really did it and made lemons taste amazing. I had some Straw Berry jam and it tasted like cotton candy. Really a great product. I wish it were a little cheaper as I\\'d like to order it three more times as Christmas gifts. Oh well though, still had a great time with it. Have tested this in the Keurig. You need to follow the exact recommendations for it to taste rich enough. It\\'s better brewed in the stove top espresso maker to help bring out a fuller bodied taste and aroma. Probably best suited for a french press. I am finding that we need to judge swiss decaf differently than the regular alternative and have to accept the lighter taste in exchange for healthily removing the caffeine. Great product.  Chips are made from fruit.  Unique. AWESOME!!!!! So yummy and so filling. I often bring one with me when I don\\'t have time for breakfast. just as advertised I got the new and was used to to older type with more carbs. I do like this very much. Better for you of course doesn\\'t quite have the same taste. I called immediately when I opened the box and left a message. Got a call within 5 minutes! Shocked but happy. He told me to google it and check it out for myself which I did. He was honest and I was totally impressed with the customer service. You do not get that often in this day and time. Fast shipping,  great product! Delicious. I love to mix this with olive oil and spread on fish or chicken and then grill. Yummy :) Good flavor, like older style gochujang it\\'s a little spicier than many of the newer ones. This is a find because even at HMart I have not found GF gochujang among the 20-30 brands they carry. This is made by the same artisan who makes Seriously Korean Gochujang. The difference? This is the thicker consistency you expect for a jar of gochujang while the other is the consistency of Sriracha. (IMO, trying to compare Sriricaha to gochujang, is like comparing pho to yukgaejang) Like thx Works really well for my moody mare. Would recommend every time over other products like Mare Magic. On time. Decent quality. Done with the chemicals in the pink packets, the blue packets, and the yellow packets?  This is the perfect alternative to sugar and artificial sweeteners.  It isn\\'t bitter at all like some of the stevia drops I\\'ve used! About the only formula that A. he likes, and B. he keeps down in full. I love this almond butter! It\\'s creamy. It\\'s a whole food. No sugar, salt, added oil or ingredients a third grader can\\'t read. This meets MY criteria for healthy eating. If you want a highly processed almond butter, don\\'t buy this.<br />I add my own sweetness. Spread it on a pita bread and yummy. It\\'s also good in recipes for baking, stir frying and saut&eacute;ed foods.<br />I could make my own butter, but why do that when this is just as good and shipped directly  to my home. I love this salt.  I use it on vegetables, italian dishes, even in deviled eggs.  It\\'s great. I\\'ve been using it for about 6 years.  Highly recommend. This is the first gluten free bread that my granddaughter really likes.  What a relief to finally find New Grains! It\\'s Cholula. In a handy packet. Do you really need to read any reviews? Good product as expected! Best Allsort every tasted. Wish they were more widely available. Great taste and fast delivery! My son Jake loves drinking out of this mug - he is a huge Darth Vader fan.  The product is very detailed and the finish is great.  Buy this for the Star Wars fan in your life. I really like this coffee and I would like it better if I could get a Krispy Kreme donut to go with it. There\\'s none in our area town and I would have to drive straight through Columbus to find one. Bummer. However it may be a good thing that\\'s the Krispy Kreme donut shop is far away or I would be like the Michelin man. :-) my husband also likes this coffee and he brings it to me in bed and has ever since we met;  23 years ago. I am in no way spoiled. :-) :-) :-) I bought it for my 80+ year old uncle who was in the hospital and not doing well.  They are his favorites.  They arrived on time, were fresh, and put a smile on his face. ok I wanted to like these.  The flavors are really unique and the first taste of them is like ooooh this might be good.  But then the alcoholy after taste hits... and not like liquor alcohol like rubbing.  Not good  EDIT: 9/4/15 I\\'m really impressed with this company.  They contacted me by phone to get my input and to further understand what my issues with the product were, including a generous offer of a refund which I declined.    As I said in my earlier review the flavor combinations were what caught my eye.  I admittedly used these in a water bottle that was more than 8ounces and as I spoke with the company representative I started wondering if I\\'d given these a real chance.  I only tried two of the flavors and used them in a 24 ounce water bottle upping the amount used proportionally.  I actually still had these around since to be honest the flavors were good, I just felt like I was getting a strong alcohol aftertaste that I felt wasn\\'t refreshing.  I decided today to retry the flavors, this time all of them, and only with 8oz of water following strictly the instructions.  The mandarin grapefruit still had the alcohol after taste to me.  But the other 3 flavors were refreshing and with the new 8oz proportion using only 2 small squeezes.   I found they did  make the water very refreshing without verging on kool-aid esque flavors that really, to me negates the purpose of drinking water at all.   Just as a sidenote, I\\'m diabetic so I don\\'t normally drink, however it was suggested to me that not only do these flavor enhancers work in water, but they\\'re also good in alcoholic drinks such as vodka martinis etc.  I had a friend make one up and I did try a sip and I have to say it was a nice way to give a little kick to an otherwise strong liquor again without overpowering it.  So I\\'m going to revise my review and give this 4 stars since I didn\\'t like the mandarin grapefruit so much, still tasting a slight alcohol aftertaste that might just have been a quirk of my tastebuds.  (I also think cilantro tastes like soap) :D  SO in conclusion, I do actually recommend this item, especially if you\\'re looking for just a hint of flavor in your water.  The lemon mint was my favorite by far.  THe most refreshing for sure. as hot as you can comfortably eat I was satisfied with my product. I\\'m looking forward to purchasing some more soon. Great coffee Yumm. Very chewy. Good quality. Value for money Love this stuff. I can get my energy boost and a serving of fruit and vegies 50 Cal. Now, I can get a 12oz red bull for the same about of cal or less but the 4pk is more expensive and I get no fruit/veggie. So, V8 wins! Out of any energy drink, this tastes the best by far. Someone told me they were going to discontinue the Blue and I stock piled the stuff. Now they sell in larger containers and I don\\'t usually/cant finish. Love it though and is the only energy drink I have and prefer over coffee any day. it was just as fun as i imagined it I’m a member of the Crowdtap Jif™ program, and Jif™ sent me a sample of its Jif™ Bars to try and asked me to review.<br /><br />The creamy peanut butter bars are REALLY good. They taste just like the peanut butter out of the jar on the outside layers. The inside (middle) layer of the creamy ones is hard to explain. It\\'s more like a traditional granola bar but not quite the same. I would definitely purchase these and recommend them to others.<br /><br />The crunchy peanut butter ones, on the other hand, I did not like. There was no outside peanut butter layer, just a top layer that was grainy granola with a couple peanuts in it. They did not taste like peanut butter from the jar, and were not very sweet at all. I would NOT buy these, and would not recommend them to others.<br /><br />The chocolate peanut butter I did not get a chance to try unfortunately, because my daughter ate it. But she loved it, and said they were definitely better than the Crunchy PB flavor.. not effective like the real flax, boiled and strained. Wanted easy way out, but this didn\\'t relieve gall bladder attack like the real thing Disgusting. Perfect. thru it out  stale Very good quality great for Pistachio Milk Impressed by the quality. They are fresh and a great value for the $$ I loved the tangy sauce, can\\'t believe it isn\\'t as popular as I should be. Vey good! Handy to have around, but expensive for everyday use. I am enjoying my every morning Matcha tea smothi with banana Easy fast breakfast. Mott\\'s 100% apple juice has a good taste, although a little stronger than other brands of apple juice (hence the dark color) so I can\\'t drink large amounts at a time like I can with other apple juice brands.  Apple juice is the kind of juice I love but I almost never buy it.  Usually it\\'s because of the high prices, but also because I prefer other juice varieties on the market so apple juice gets pushed to the back of my want list.  However when I\\'m really in the mood for it, I want to drink an entire bottle at once! This item was a total joke!! 5G??? It only covered 4 cookies!!! Also it tasted terrible....AND it was NOT navy, it was royal blue!!! Stay clear of this&#34;tiny dab&#34; of glitter!!!!! Great product for a great price. Fast shipping & item as described. I love this coffee substitute, but the shipping is pricey. excellent Perfect! This was my second order... I seem to be addicted! The combination of sweet and spicy is irresistible ! I am ordering my third bag I just love that bread . It\\'s making you easily full, tastes amazing with a tiny bit butter, lettuce ,tomatoes and a slice havarti cheese. Even with salmon it tastes great . If you\\'re not German and don\\'t know that bread you need to get used to the taste . My husband is a coffee snob and he loves this stuff in our french press. I am pregnant so have not tried it but it smells very good when brewed and per my husband it is very smooth. Sorry to have waiting so long to try this.  It is better than milk.  Add a meal powder replacement and you are just over 100 calories. This has always been my favorite brand of curry paste.  I couldn\\'t find it in any stores when I moved, so I used AMZ to buy it & am very happy. I bought this product at a grocery.  Its no different than amazon would send.  I use a Cuisinart k-cup brewer with Keurig core.  Seattle\\'s Best House Blend K-cups in my unit yield 4 oz\\'s when the unit is set to brew 8.  And sometimes it won\\'t brew at all.  I\\'ve had nothing like this problem with any other k-cup (Green Mountain, Starbucks, Marley, Lavazza, various Kona\\'s).  I disassembled one k-cup and it looks like the problem may be the fineness of the grind.  Once its wet it forms an impenetrable block.  I can\\'t comment on what this coffee tastes like because I haven\\'t able to brew a fair cup to sample. Excellent coffee and service as always! Expensive Shipped item at advertised. Good product The image was perfect and everything looked great!!  I applied it to my daughter\\'s cake and it was simple and easy to follow the instructions.  I like that we can have a fresh homemade cake in any flavor and decorate it ourselves.  It worked out perfectly. My kids love this stuff Delicious fizz with a touch of juice and served in a small portion. LOVEEEEE! Just don\\'t add too much salt. Already has salt in it. Delicious! This is by far, one of the better M&M flavors I have tried. Though, to be fair, it doesn\\'t taste even remotely like pecan pie. I\\'m not even sure why it\\'s called Pecan Pie seeing as there is not a hint of the flavor in these candies. So, what does it taste like? Maple logs! This should have been a Canada themed &#34;Patriotic&#34; release, because it\\'s not pecan.<br /><br />Still, it\\'s the best flavor ever! Fresh and delicious and oh so healthy. Awesome! Tasted great!  All gone now... Love my Bacos just my supermarkets here dont carry anymore Is exactly what I wanted.  Will buy again This is true Ceylon cinnamon. Better and safer than cassia cinnamon. I am very satisfied with it. I got them for making lemon artichoke coating for salmon and chicken.  The artichokes are wonderful. Awesome This was exactly what we were looking for to make our Hugo drinks! This was exactly what was needed! Second purchase.  Good coffee.  And no unwanted decaf! Love it:) this is the best cacao raw powder ever. I have made every thing from choc protein drinks to choc. sauce which I call sarilcious named after my granddaughter,and the gluten free choc. cake . My boyfriend thinks it has an unmistakably great. Thank-you amazon for making available such gourmet healthy products from around the world! Everyone asks where I get this from!! A perfect compliment to most everything! there are absolutely no instructions or recipes on pkg I loved the old formula. I sang Zevia\\'s praises to whomever would listen. I ordered by the multiple cases. And then, they decided to go non-GMO. That\\'s usually a good thing. Unfortunately, the new formulas are just awful. And, somehow, they managed to wreck the fizz. THE FIZZ! The new formulas go flat very quickly, especially with ice. Please, Zevia, bring back the old formulas! Now I\\'m off to buy Blue Sky, which had been the inferior brand but is now the only option left. This had more Brazil nuts (that I don\\'t really like) than I remember it having in a previous order.  Also, the jar either got beat up in transport or before it came to me as there were a lot of broken nuts/pieces in the bottom of the jar when I opened the box in which they arrived. I have ordered these coffee pods many times. when my husband tasted the latest batch, he said that it really lacked in flavor.<br />When our houseguests said the same thing, I decided to post this warning. I am sending back the remaining boxes. have one for breakfast almost every morning, great warmed for a few seconds in the microwave. Delicious Tea I had never tried this but read about it in a receipe in the wonderful book, Red Sparrow.  Made a spagetti pie with it  and it was spectacular. Works just as well as regular vinegar and a fraction of the price. Great quality, delicious, worked perfectly in the graham cracker crust I was making! I reviewed this product because I received it through crowd tap.  However, my views are my own.  I really like the on-to-go bars.  They were filling and tasty.  Great for quick snacks when in the car or at work to hold me over for lunch!  I enjoyed the peanut butter taste.  My only suggestion - more peanut butter! Tasty for being decaf. I got excited when I saw this toddler meal as it sounds just what my baby would love to eat (we are going on a 18 hour flight so I\\'m looking for snacks and meals for him.) I ordered some of these, only to realize it has PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED SOYBEAN OIL. Really?! Do you need carcinogens in a toddler meal?! And the soybean oil is probably GMO too, as I noticed (too late) it didn\\'t say it wasn\\'t.<br />Thanks but no thanks. My baby is not eating this. good Tastes like cardboard.  Really very sad tasting.  And adding extra table salt doesn\\'t do the proverbial &#34;trick&#34;  If you can, use this packet along with .5 of the sodium version (granulated) and it should be drinkable.  I really expected to like this version, but I didn\\'t and don\\'t! Coffee was very smooth, variety pack gave me a taste of each of the different kinds and I have chosen my faves.  I like to make my cups 10oz size and I am always on the look out for a coffee that is strong enough to still taste like a decent coffee when made with 10oz.  Both the French Roast and the Fog Chaser were perfect fits into this category.  Fog chaser is much stronger a brew and tastes GREAT when I made it as a 10oz cup.  Best thing is these all worked perfectly in my Keurig 2.0 maker, they have an orange color ring around each pod and fit perfectly, bottom mesh is not punctured and the top stays firmly attached (saw old reviews that said it came off).  All and all I loved each flavor but will be reordering the French Roast and Fog Chaser as staples in this house. GREAT!  Thanks So much and God bless!  &#60;&#62;&#60; I\\'d heard the Ceylon Cinnamon is a better product for those who want to add cinnamon as a supplement to their health regime. My husband uses it daily so I needed a larger amount that normal. This brand tastes great and is something I will be buying again. Made great soymilk with it and it tastes fresh, not extremely, but doesn\\'t have the nasty old bean taste that would ruin the whole thing. The chocolate was white and tasted old. I could not eat them and threw them away. Love this product. Everything about them is amazing, except for the fact it has green apple instead of lime.  3 stars for green apple.  5 stars if it had lime.  I\\'m not sure how many you would have to eat to get diabetes, but I think this 2 pack of more than 5lbs will help get you there. I bought it because there are no added vitamins... A and D.  I don\\'t remember if this product is advertised as instant, but it mixes well enough, if it is not. Terrific product!  A unique flavor I have never been able to reproduce from scratch.  A perk is that the product comes in small, plastic packets (four servings each approximately), so there is minimal clean-up and no need for storage space in the fridge.  I will be purchasing the product, I suspect, for years to come. Best overall flavor in my book.  Not the cheapest 3 fruit out there, but great flavor. , Dundee Cut is the best.  Used to see it on the shelf in British markets all the time.  (Not in clear glass jars of course...)  (especially good on toasted English Muffins...) Shipping is a killer, there sure ain\\'t nothing light about glass jars full of marmalade. I used to live near Toronto and would buy the mustard at the St Lawrence Market. I was so happy when I found the mustard on Amazon. Great, great mustard!!! Kozliks also has other excellent varieties--both sweet and savory. Now, if Amazon would only carry Purdys too!!! healthy and great Good flavor and muxh cheaper than in the market. new tea flavor for me and i love it! Peppermint tea is one of my favorites and this brand is just as good as the expensive brand. My son loves this product! It was not like it was pictured, I wanted all yellow and it was assorted packs sent. Awesome opportunity for a family vegetarian to enjoy a summer tradition.  We will be purchasing more in the future. Really enjoy my daily tea!  It\\'s a great liver detoxer and tastes great with a little organic sugar.  I love that it\\'s decaf also so I can enjoy it at night before bed to relax. Good taste but if you intend on using it as a condiment, you will either want to go easy on it or want to mix it with something.<br /><br />It is very salty, which is to be expected.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Tasty<br />* Good consistency for pouring, dipping, and spreading.<br />* Container is BPA-free, squeezable plastic<br /><br />Cons:<br />* The bottle does not have a spout under the lid. So, you will have to pour carefully or scoop out desired amount with a utensil. great This is the best, the healthiest salt ever.<br />Celtic Sea  salt has all the minerals and very tasty.<br />It is gray and large course .... but for me it is not a problem, I use coffee grinder to grind it, to make it fine table salt. I save money that way. I do not use a salt shaker because the salt is moist and will not go through the holes. I just use salt dish like it was used in old days.<br />Give it a try, you will like it as much as I do. The curry has a good flavor. Great product!  Arrived on time Came melted, but its summer so...... Lost 3.4 lbs in three weeks!  Helps to curb my appetite to make better choices. I tolerate usually only one pill daily as I am not a coffee drinker. Provides an extra boost of energy for exercise endurance.  Will take the 2nd pill if I need a little energy in the afternoon (recommended dose is 1-2 pills per day based on your daily caffeine intake).  My skin looks amazing. I love that this supplement is derived from natural products . Ordered more today. Highly recommended. I love this brand of collagen because It is so easy to use. It dissolves so quickly and the taste is very mild. I use i to heal my acne prone skin.My hair also likes it. It also lasts for a long time:) would purchase again. first time trying oolong tea. first off, when its described as a &#34;woody&#34; flavored tea, they literally mean like taking tiny wood sticks, boiling them in water, and bam! that\\'s what this tastes like lol. so it is an acquired taste for sure. I didn\\'t enjoy it at all at the beginning but I really didn\\'t want it to go to waste and eventually it grew on me. As for losing weight, maybe its different for everyone but I didn\\'t see a drastic change. I drank it once in the morning & in the afternoon mon-fri at my job. maybe I need to religiously drink it for a long time to really see results :( Kids loved it. I had to throw away one 8 pack of this juice because it was moldy and I didn\\'t want to unwrap the pack and be exposed to the mold. Not sure why this happened. I had purchased this product before and been very happy. We have been buying canned tomato soup for some time as my children love it- even buying ones that are more home style ( though not organic).  The chunks of tomato were fairly small if your family does not enjoy a chunky soup this may not be for you.  This was not a family favorite for us due to lack of good flavor.  Somehow with organic products this often happens.  We tasted little of the basil that was supposed to be a prominent flavor.  It would be better to just add some fresh before you eat it. Do not think because it is organic that it is healthy--it still had a lot of sugar and sodium.  The serving size is supposed to be half a box which feels like a small portion for an adult.  If you are trying to buy healthy this is not a great option but in a pinch it is at least decent. A little more pricey than expected. Love Stur! Trying to do without sugar or artificial sweetners. If you read the labels on some flavor enhancers claiming to use Stevia they actually contain sugar or artificial products. Happy to find stevia based Stur! This is my favorite canned coconut milk. Tea color is yellow-green not true green. Pills supplied were reasonably fresh, (they become softer when not fresh) and although there was an almost  two week delay in arrival, they were<br />very well  packed perfectly and therefore assured receipt in best order with no  internal damage either. Excellent tea, enjoyed daily.  Especially good price and quality for organic decaffeinated green tea. I learned about zevia a several months ago.  I absolutely love it.  My only complaint was literally the added color in the soda.  And then they went to dye-free sodas!!!  I couldn\\'t have been happier.<br /><br />I have been able to successful shed almost 25lbs in the last few months and a huge part of that is having something that fills me up and conquers my sweet tooth. I drink one everyday with lunch. I have told so many people about it.  Even bought some for my mom to try.  She texted me days later and said she had the munchies but because of the black cherry zevia she was able to not blow her diet but still have something sweet.<br /><br />I do NOT taste a differences in the colored vs colorless sodas.  It is sad how much marketing makes us assume that colors = flavor.  It does\\'t have to be colorful to be good.  I for one am happy that we are actually drinking a real drink without added ingredients that is just there to make it look good.  I am also thrilled about it being GMO free verified.  One of my concerns was the Erythritol since that is something that can come from corn.  But after it went GMO-free Zevia rose 100 points.<br /><br />Overall, zevia is allowing me to diet and be successful.  I can\\'t tell enough people about zevia.  My favorite flavor is probably the ginger ale. Great product My very favorite coffee!!!! This water tastes amazing!  I\\'m someone that hates drinking water. Most water tastes gross, but this water is ddifferent. It tastes amazing. So for the first time in my life I drank 64 oz in less than a day because I wanted to, not because I have to :)  knowing it has great health benefits is just icing on the proverbial cake! Very good product. Excellent for your health. YUMMY! these made a cool, and elegant addition to a cake YUMMY!!!! Worth the wait every time I order it! Love it !!Taste great!! Great price with quick delivery. Well packed and instructions provided. Absolutely fabulous!  We love this product. So convenient, and saves room in the refrigerator. Makes a good glass of tea. What can I say? Very good with coffee and tea! The marshmallow bags were difficult to open.  The marshmallows were melted and stuck not only to themselves but the bags.  These were meant to be added to a snack mix for a child\\'s birthday party.  I was unable to use them because they were one/a few big globs of marshmallow and because of that they did not resemble ice cream cones nor did they work for the snack mix.  Very disappointed. Not worth the price A crunchy, salty, delicious, guilt-free, protein packed snack. I picked up a bag of Snack Out Loud Crunchy Bean Snacks at a store near me. The bag I grabbed was multi serving & they were so good I ate the whole thing. I knew I wanted more, but knew I would need single serve bags since my will power isn\\'t the best. Found them on Amazon, ordered the sea salt & tried the ranch, too. They were delivered quickly, loved both flavors (as did my 11 year old son) & I\\'m going to order more as soon as I\\'m done writing this : ) GREAT!  Thanks So much and God bless!  &#60;&#62;&#60; At first, I was disappointed that it was a new, different flavor; however, I have adjusted and like it just fine. great product at a very reasonable price Great taste. Great candy, though it burns my tongue! great japanese snack. My 6 year old finds it HILARIOUS! Very small amount - I should have paid more attention to the size. Doesn\\'t taste as good as other oolong teas I\\'ve tried. Love yogurt made with these. Best coffee ever Delicious flavor I will be honest, I have been pretty disappointed with many of the Walden Farms products such as the salad dressing (I\\'d rather eat my salads dry than use them). However, I decided to give the syrup a try after reading the reviews and I am glad I did. I don\\'t know by what sorcery they were able to make this but I can\\'t even really tell the difference between this which is entirely void of sugar and calories and regular syrup which is entirely saturated in sugar and calories. The texture is correct, the flavor is correct and the consistency is correct. Like I said, I have not been a fan of many of the Walden farm\\'s products but they somehow nailed this one. Sprouted easily after a brief overnight soak and they\\'ve grown to harvest height in just 8 days! This is my first time growing wheatgrass and it\\'s been an awesome, straightforward process. I\\'m going to use some of the leftovers for cooking, too, so nothing goes to waste. I was pleased with the product. Soooo good and they have a real hit of some fruit , I don\\'t know if it is raspberry or what but I love them. Kids love these. great snacks....love it. Great to pack in a lunch, especially during the fall and winter when a lot of fruit is out of season. natural refreashing I wanted to like it but the taste was very grassy and sometimes smelled like fried chicken. I did get used to the taste and smell however it did not wake me up as other quality teas do. I love love love this salmon....perfect for patties, salads ot right out of the can....wouldn\\'t buy any other.  The seller also has GREAT customer service. Always good but prices keep going up always. Best ones I ordered or tried Delicious! Can\\'t wait to buy more. Just got a bag of the regular size sour patch kids and they\\'re not as good. Great I no longer use liquid broth after discovering these. I get these for my granddaughter,  She loves them!! It was no usual pack.<br />Best regards, JK This is some of the best hot sauce I\\'ve ever had, it\\'s hot but not overpowering the great flavors. Who doesn\\'t love gum? This stuff has a great minty flavor and the crunchy shell makes it even more fun. Excellent flavorful product! Thanks!! Quick delivery and product is awesome I was looking for a simple, pure protein source to add to my morning smoothies. So far the casein has been the least  noticeable.<br />Sunday i used the pea protein. It has an earthy flavor that I didnt mind but my husband wasnt fond of. Had I added more rice milk I think it would have helped. I liked it but had to adjust my mind to it. I noticed that I was certainly not hungry 2.5 hours later like normal with a smoothie. I like this protein since its dairy free and didnt upset my stomach at all.<br />Monday I used the casein protein. I was happy that this didnt alter the taste of my smoothie aside from making it creamier and slightly more dull tasting. I was fine with this. I really liked this since it didnt really taste but am still on the fence about the dairy issue. I am not vegan but we are trying to cut our intake down as its really just not great for you in large quantities.<br />Tuesday: Goat protein. I was excited and nervous about this all at the same time. I love the idea of goat milk but find that the flavor is more than our family can adjust to. Upon opening the package I detected no hint of goat smell. After adding it to my smoothie it added the same creamy smoothness to it like the casein did. I only noticed a hint of goat as a mild aftertaste that left quickly. If you didnt know what that flavor was it could easily be dismissed. I really enjoyed this smoothie but its still a dairy and it the most expensive protein offered by naked nutrition so that is certainly a factor.<br />Wednesday: rice protein day. So in fairness to this smoothie, I upped the maca a bit and added a fistful of kale which is different to the others. This smoothie is decidedly grittier than the others as has no hint of creaminess that they had. Since this is a plant protein I this the pea is the only one you can fairly compare to. It is gritty but has less of a flavor than the pea. Its still drinkable and not tastes fine but I dont know if this is the one I want to have daily for the full 5 pounds.<br />Thursday: Whey protein. I saved this for last since I was the least excited about it for some reason. I\\'ll post tomorrow after I try it.the full 5 pounds.<br />Thursday: Whey protein. I saved this for last since I was the least excited about it for some reason. I\\'ll post tomorrow after I try it. I did not really like this. It was my first time buying molasses and it\\'s a little bitter for me. If you like it the size seemed like a good value. IN THE TOOL BOX Good tasting. I ordered this twice and I dont give it a 5 start because first order i love them very fresh and very yummy, but my second order was mushi and smell soo bad that i have to throw it in trash excellent. First bought it at Costco and they pulled it from the shelves. So happy the old Dentyne that I love is available again! This tastes so good. It is a great blend of sweet & spicy. It is very moist. I didn\\'t give it 5 stars because it simply is not enough for the price. I know there are others out there that cost the same and don\\'t taste as good. But, come on! If it\\'s going to taste this good, put a little more in the bag. It\\'s not the kind of tough jerky that you gnaw on for awhile. It\\'s moist, in smaller pieces, and eaten very quickly. delicious Excellent instant espresso for mixing into homemade mocha frappes! The flavor is just right, I use about 1 Tablespoon of this per 1 cup of milk when making my frappe. Well, sometimes this is better than real onions. I enjoy using it with our food. It so good with soups and pasta. Great taste. Good, but there aren\\'t very many in a package. The quality is an excellent (thick, not watery) with the added benefit that it is organic. My vet recommended I add pumpkin to my dog\\'s diet. His digestive issues have greatly improved and I couldn\\'t be more pleased. My kids and I are completely obsessed with cotton candy, however the majority of the cotton candy on the market is NOT organic, so when I discovered this organic cotton candy from Spun Paradise Cotton Candy Co., I knew that we had to give it a try...imagine, delicious flavored cotton candy, but organic! Hooray!<br /><br />My cotton candy package arrived quickly to my home and was in perfect condition in the very nice plastic containers. I am always iffy about ordering food through the mail, however, this cotton candy was perfect, not melted or damaged in any way. We ordered 4 different flavors, and had to immediately try each and every one. The Coconut has to be my absolute favorite flavor. It absolutely so delicious with a very true coconut flavor. The coconut did seem to have a tiny bit of a different texture than the other flavors, though this wasn\\'t an issue of any kind, I just thought I would point it out! :)  I also found that this cotton candy doesn\\'t just melt away like typical cheapie cotton candy tends to. It melts nicely in the mouth and is absolutely delicious. I will never ever ever go back to the average run of the mill cotton candy and will definitely be repurchasing from Spun Paradise in the future!!<br /><br />I received this product at no cost to me and have provided my honest and unbiased review in return. This has a great flavor. I enjoy it every morning This organic rubbed sage seems very fresh.  Be aware though that the pieces are cut pretty big, so I won\\'t use it as a spice; I\\'ll use it as a tea. The best brand of Liquid SMoke I\\'ve found so far. Tastes great, lasts a long time. Do not use more than recommended as it will overpower everything though! I\\'d buy more if it weren\\'t so pricey. As for now, it\\'s a special treat. nice! Thanks Being a bit a long time tea drinker I really wanted to get some good pu-erh tea and was only looking for aged tea in cake form.  I\\'m was a little worried about the investment without tasting it first but seemed to have good reviews.  I can honestly say its one of the best i\\'ve had.  Deep rick red brown look and incredibly clean taste. why does the reese\\'s company lie to us? it is not the peanut butter in the reese\\'s peanut butter cup. I\\'m sure others love these but mine just tasted bland. Maybe my jar was stale? It was 3 days before its expiration date and yep, tasted stale. Fig Newtons were delicious and  exactly as advertised These diced tomatoes were not bad for being organic. It also helped there\\'s no salt added.<br />Unfortunately, I need to watch my sodium intake.<br /><br />I have purchased this item, personally for me, at the full retail price. There\\'s<br />no relationship with the seller or the company of this product. Absolutely<br />there\\'s zero compensation involved for my review. I am solely reviewing my<br />experience for other potential customers. Good value for money I been purchasing these Gerber Graduates for my twin for a long time now.  They are now 2+ and still enjoy them very much.  They dissolve easy and are low calorie snack.  Great alternative to chips, pretzels and other snacks which are loaded with preservatives and high sodium. I been guilty enjoying them as well.  I buy in bulk since we go through these pretty quickly.  One thing to note if you buy in bulk make sure you don\\'t store them for too long, as they tend to get a bit stale.  Other then that a great product. Love this tea! My goal was to try and match a Starbucks Vanilla Latte, and unfortunately this tasted nothing like it.  Would not buy again. Heaven on earth, that is what this fudge is.  I are on a low carb diet.  I was craving some really good fudge.  This is it.  One serving goes a long way satisfying your sweet tooth without all the sugar, calories, and carbs.  Packaged attractively.  No stomach upset.  It is perfection! I will definitely buy, again, and again. Low Carb Patti Poor quality and quantity, think small then think smaller.  Looking for kids lunches and this was not the right fit at all. Very Disappointed with this product. Packagaing stated 48 bars, 8 of each type. We received 42 bars, NO strawberry and 10 grape. Would NOT buy this again or recommend it to others! Seriously, what is not to love about Arizona Diet Green Tea and the reason that I got them from an Amazon Vendor was because I was having a very hard time getting them here. Product was not as described:  The description is for dark chocolate with almonds, but I received only a mixture of various kinds of bars (caramel, crunch, etc.) -- but NONE with almonds. Kind Bars, a regular staple in my diet; always good to carry for a quick, nutritious snack. You either love Marmite, or you hate it.  I happen to love it, and I\\'m one of those people who loves the savory delicious flavor of Marmite.  I\\'m thankful  was able to get it here in the United States. Great and yummy dates when you receive them but they tend to dry up pretty fast, even when you re-close the bag after each serving. I get it from this dealer all the time. Best price+quality!<br />It helps me save in the long run because I don\\'t really use an entire king size, but the regular ones are too small! This is perfect. Like a roll of tissue paper. Just rip out what you need! Its good, but I prefer the regular over the natural.  It says that it doesn\\'t separate, but it does separate some - however, not as bad as other natural peanut butters  I only bought the natural PP because at the time, no one was selling a case of the regular creamy.  Still tastes good though, and I\\'m not sorry I bought it. When I opened the shipment from Amazon and inspected the can - I could faintly smell the delicious fresh black pepper.  Then, when I used the pepper to cook with - it lives up to it\\'s reputation.  I plan to purchase this again. These are tasty little treats, especially with salsa and cheese. I bought a whole case that we are working through. So far one bag was stale, but I haven\\'t had any more issues. Our cats just love this Hairball Aid. Every morning they are just begging for it. And it works! Able to get it reasonably priced. Excellent! We use it on everything from chicken to baked potatoes !! Strawberry is bland. Mix it with the triple citrus and delicious. Like the original mix the best. Enjoy Not the greatest Was unable to fine it,so I ordered 2 jars,then when I did see some here it was only 1.99 each,man did I over paid. Shame on me not again I was very excited to try these bars since I have always been a Jif peanut butter fan and saw that they had 8 grams of protein. The bars were chewier than I expected and placing them in the fridge made them pretty hard. There are several flavors and each were good- but even the ones with chocolate just didn\\'t have an overwhelming flavor and was not very memorable. Overall, I liked them well enough for a real peanut butter protein bar - but they are not something I would crave.<br /><br />“I’m a member of the Crowdtap Jif™ program, and Jif™ sent me a sample of its Jif™ Bars to try and asked me to review.&#34; good stuff Excellent water.  Worth the cost.  I get a case every month Tastes great as ice tea. This stuff is the most ridiculously  good soda.  But make no mistake about it - it\\'s soda.  Don\\'t think you are getting a flavored water or sparkling soda.  It\\'s straight up soda.  Sweet, rich, and delicious.  Nice when you have a craving for a bit of sugar.  Also good for making grown-up drinks. The flavor is actually very strong, not like some other \\'natural sugar gum\\' that I\\'ve tried. The texture is also very good, it doesn\\'t get soft and disintegrates like some other \\'natural gums.\\'  Its similar to \\'Chicklet\\' in appearance and size and even taste. I\\'ll continue to get it. I tried this flavor and will try the others.  The mint flavor is pretty strong, which I liked. Got this for my Daughter and son n law. They love this tea Yummy and healthy This is one of the better flavors from Blue Diamond\\'s wide range of flavors. It\\'s not that spicy, just enough of a kick. Absolutely delicious!! The peanuts are huge and abundant...it is dangerous...can\\'t leave it alone. This peanut brittle is so special we are giving it to the guests at my daughter\\'s upcoming wedding. Thank you for a wonderful snack that looks as yummy as it tastes!! delicious Delicious, but the Cucumber has spoiled me for anything else! A little goes along way. Makes a terrific latte with vanilla almond milk, cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg...yum These are terrific. I used them to make candy. I did one batch with them soaked in orange liquor and one without and then coated them with dark chocolate. Both were amazing. Definitely a product worth purchasing again. Good flavor, like older style gochujang it\\'s a little spicier than many of the newer ones. This is a find because even at HMart I have not found GF gochujang among the 20-30 brands they carry. This is made by the same artisan who makes Wholly Gochujang. The difference? This is the consistency of Sriracha while the other is the thicker consistency you expect for a jar of gochujang. (IMO, trying to compare Sriricaha to gochujang, is like comparing pho to yukgaejang) honestly love this product. went to target, Meijer, Walmart and these things were way over priced and looked just like this. so in love with this product that I had to end up buying my mom one too. so worth 12.99!!!! Tastes great, organic, low sodium, and gluten-free.<br /><br />Here\\'s a recipe for Turkey And Zucchini Quinoa Pasta Casserole With Mozzarella:<br /><br />Turkey And Zucchini Quinoa Pasta Casserole With Mozzarella<br />Ingredients for 5 servings<br />~32 oz lean ground turkey (93%)<br />8 oz (1 box) quinoa pasta (shells)<br />5/8 cup shredded mozzarella (1/8 cup on each)<br />1/2 red onion (chopped)<br />2 cups zucchini (chopped)<br />1 bell pepper (chopped)<br />2 tomatoes<br />1 cup chicken broth<br />Two 6 oz can tomato paste<br /><br />Directions<br />1.

At best, the paint quality is 3 to 3.5 stars - and that\\'s being generous. Because the first bamboo plant I received arrived so healthy and green, is why I gave it a 4 stars - that, and even with the poor paint job on the pandas, they are still really cute!<br /><br />Anyway, the 2 panda pots I received do not look much like the image at all, because unlike the vibrant dark blacks in the image of the panda, the one\\'s I received, the panda are barely covered in black (a lot of missed areas), and is more of a dark charcoal grey, than a vibrant black.  Not that big of a deal, as I will eventually get some glossy black paint, and brighten it up some.<br /><br />The first panda pot that arrived, had a couple of small chips in it.  One on the right ear, and the other just below the left eye - which were painted over to cover.  The left eye of the panda, kind of reminded me of the KISS pandas, as seen here...<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0105PPR7U Wellcoda | Kiss Wild Panda Band Womens NEW Rockstar Black T-shirt M]]<br /><br />9GreenBox took care of it, by sending me a new panda pot - as well as another plant - which I was not expecting. I offered to send back the chipped one, but they didn\\'t want it - so it\\'s going to be a backup pot. in case the new one breaks.<br /><br />The first bamboo plant I received is doing very well, especially after adding plant/bamboo food to it. Sadly, the 2nd bamboo plant isn\\'t doing all that great, even after adding plant/bamboo food to it.  But I am not ready to give up on it, as I am hoping with a little more time and care, it\\'ll bounce back.<br /><br />This is the plant bamboo food I bought, in case you want to check it out - as it really does seem to work...<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0030FETG8 KL Design & Import - 20 Bottles of Super Green Green Lucky Bamboo Fertilizer Plant Food *NEW*]]<br /><br />All-in-all, I am pretty impressed with the ability to ship a live plant, and how well 9GB packages them.

I will definitely be ordering from them again, whether it be for myself, or as a gift for someone else. =) This is not pie filling. It was pitted cherries in cherry flavored water.  The cherries had no flavor at all.  After I opened the can, I threw the contents into the blender and made a flavorless red smoothie. they did not taste like dr. pepper at all. I tried these at a farmer\\'s market in CO, and was SO excited to see that I could get them at AMAZON when I got home.  They are SUCH a good food to have when traveling, and are a good source of protein, fiber, and tasty! So much cleaner than real peanut butter. Took the tablet and absolutely nothing happened Love the taste. Price is right. love the juice...im on the juice. I love it!  Gives my soup a wonderful flavor Love, love, love this garlic, we add to everything I love this tea so much... it is a real help right after a lactose intolerance attack and really makes a difference in how well you feel the next day<br />because it is loaded with electrolytes and REPLACES the electrolytes depleted after an attack making you feel lousy. So happy I found these teas. They come in several different flavors as well. Absolutely delicious. Tastes like maple syrup with bourbon (particularly good with Maker\\'s Mark). My favorite bitters out of the 15 I\\'ve tried so far. Was leery of using this but since I became vegan no longer use real cheese.  I was pleasantly surprised at how great this tastes, not just for pasta recipes, but on salads, and also is wonderful for flavoring popcorn. Great coffee. Was looking for an alternative to juicing when I travel - this is NOT the winner.  Taste was horrible and there was some odd taste in the powder - it seemed as if it was artificial maybe - it was just not right.  Threw the container away. Just as described.  Great for a Mickey Mouse themed party. Very good pork hocks...a blast from the past. As recommended, I kept them non-refrigerated and they remained tender until they were gone. (Which was only a few weeks) Beyond delicious! We almost ate the whole bag at one sitting! Service manager is a very outstanding person with my order. The product was outstanding I highly recomment this product to all  lobster was fresh alive and just outstanding Love the rich flavor of this tea. I recently purchased a newer Keurig and found out that I could no longer use some of my k-cups, until I found these. Wow, these little stickers really do work! They are very easy to use, simply place the sticker in the 9 o\\'clock position on the top of the k-cup. I would definitely buy again, but doubt I will ever need to as these stickers can be used over and over again! Great idea, great product! I have tried almost every gluten free flour and this one is by far the best. It is extremely versatile and easy to use as a cup for cup replacement in baking. I use the pancake recipe weekly and also use it in muffins. I love this stuff; it\\'s not too sweet and is carbonated! The smell brings my good mood! Great! The cookies were stale. I should have returned them for a fresher box. These seeds are AWESOME!  I love the smokey sugary take when you first put them in your mouth.  And what\\'s even better, I got them at Dollar Tree for $1 a pack. just as described. perfect. Use this all of the time. Tastes OK. It is listed as Organic on Amazon but the company will not label the product as such which brings into question if it really is.  The coffee is average tasting and if i cant be sure that it is Organic, then it isn\\'t worth purchasing. Great! I have ordered a lot of different brands of pistachios from Amazon.<br />These are by far the most delicious I have had.  Fresh and just enough salt.<br />Ordering 2 more now. Not sweet enough and you have to use two pods each time you brew 10 ounces of tea! Expensive for what you get. Great with crab cakes! Love it! These are nice, a little chewy I throw a handful into my smoothie in the morning and add some to my muesli. This is my all time fav instant noodles. I think it\\'s smaller than the ones that are available at asian markets but doesn\\'t bother me. The exp date on my is Jan 2016. I received a coupon to try this product through BzzAgent. Not having had much V8 in the past I was a bit worried that this wouldn\\'t take good. Totally blown away that this tastes amazing... Put that together with the fact that V8 is so good for you AND that this really does give you energy, I am so excited I tried this. The cans are small in size and they are so easy to put into coolers and have in your backpack. I would really recommend getting this again. The quality of this tea was very high. The aroma upon opening the package was full and robust, which tells me it was well packaged. The product itself brews nicely and imparts a strong flavor. Be sure not to over or under steep and it will be excellent. Overall I was very pleased with this product.<br />Lapsang Souchong in general is a tanic tea for those who like a strong and smokey flavor. i really love it this kind of sesame. i share with my mother-in law she love it. Great light fragrance Second order - taste greate. Great spice mix, we do curries and other dishes with it. I am a fan of black licorice and these little spirals were great. I ordered because of the natural flavor and ingredients instead of going for the fake stuff. Not as sweet as the fake stuff..But SO much better tasting. I will definitely order again! This is the weirdest &#34;soup&#34; I ever tasted.  But, instead of throwing it out, I added MSG, salt, pepper, powdered onion, spike seasoning, lemon juice, olive oil, celery, corn, Sriracha, and I can\\'t remember what else to make it edible.  Still was leaving a funky taste in my mouth. I\\'m a power lifter with a pretty strict eating and snacking regime... when i discovered this product through #Crowdtap, i was extremely excited to give it a shot. Folks who take supplements constantly KNOW what it is like to give up on taste in sacrifice for Macros and nutritional values...<br /><br />let me tell you through experiencing all 3 flavours... this stuff is LEGIT. i indulge in this delight on the drive back home from the gym after my post W/O shake...and there is ZERO FLAVOUR SACRIFICE! i love these bars...and i hope theyre here to stay! Tasty but way too salty for me. Awesome strong coffee! Your product is alright.  Not appealing to my taste buds. Syrup is great - however - the shipping left us with 2 leaking bottles / caps and a sticky mess.  They need to re-think their sealing process. Good quality love this! I have a number of olive oils in my pantry for different uses.  I was first introduced to this one in the Rosebud Restaurants in Chicago area.  It is their dipping oil.  It is a fruity but delicate olive oil which makes it delicious as a dipping oil or in a salad dressing with just a few ingredients.  Don\\'t overpower the delicious flavor with too many ingredients. a friend had been given to him as a gift and wanted to know where he could buy it so I gave it to him as a gift Fantastic I love the bagels it tastes good toast it. My daughter LOVES these cookies!!  They are easy for her to hold and feed to herself. Always try to keep these in the house to satisfy my hubby\\'s sweet tooth (mine too).  All our friends look for the container when they come to visit This is my favorite flavor . The bottle is small enough so you can take it with you anywhere. You only use a small amount so they last a long time and very few calories . Great smoke flavor. This is really good sauce, great price for organic. It is a perfect base to add whatever spices you want for your dish! just as advertised As expected. Goes good with my shakes. Not at good as the first bag I purchased. Too many bad ones. I was hesitant at first to switch over to Stevia but am truly glad i did.<br />I am glad i bought 4 (800) boxes when i did .. i paid $15.50 each .. now they are selling with a 325% mark up .. does not make sense. this is either greed or the stevia leaf has become the new gold .. but morethan likely it is greed. But you can check out Cash and Carry also, they have good Rice Bran oil This is a good, healthy protein shake to have after a work out to replenish your fuel. It organic and wholesome. I got the 2 percent which was missing half the fat. That wasn\\'t all that went missing in this version of Kraft Deluxe mac and cheese. It\\'s actually not bad. It\\'s just not very good. Compared to the other Deluxe offerings, the flavor is bland. The macaroni cooks up tender in eight minutes. Don\\'t leave it too long, because unlike some of the other eblows in this series, this mac can overcook rather easily. The cheese sauce is very creamy and mine was definitely fresh. It\\'s just so mild tasting it almost tastes like nothing. This is especially a problem if you are going to add anything to it, like the chicken and broccoli recommended on the box. This cheese sauce is not going to go very far without some doctoring. I added buffalo wing sauce to mine and it was much better. If you have a picky eater in the house, this might be a safe choice. Product arrived smashed up in a ball. Also, I was missing one package &#34;the Pomegranate and Mango&#34;. The price on these is significantly higher than the other flavors suddenly.  I didn\\'t check the price before my monthly subscription shipment, boooooooo. Shame on you for jacking the price up so significantly The Coconut amino are absolutely delicious!  They are a healthy alternative to soy sauce. I love this tea. Since I was born and raised in the States I\\'m not the best resource for what\\'s truly good tea, but I have tried many UK brands and this one is my favorite. It has full flavor and very smooth. I have purchased Lyons tea in bags for a over a year now and prefer the loose. Fast shipping, great price, and nice and fresh. You must try these. You\\'ll never go back to supermarket brands again. The taste is fresh and the sardines are plump. Excellent value. I love this kick butt pepper to on my pizza, pasta, etc. I also use the oil for cooking to kick it up a notch.<br />Yes price is steep, but have not yet found any other brand with this amount of heat and flavor. So far so good! No funny taste or texture. I add it to almost all my smoothies. Still too good... a bit pricy. Awesome!!! Great taste! I have been using these for years as my favorite spice right behind lemon pepper.  I don\\'t cook much of anything without using this.  Hard to find at local stores.?? Not sure why? Tastes like regular Lance crackers.  Very good. love Fabulous! Please stock in every U.S. Supermarket! mmmmm....tasty! Great This is a strong flavored tea  and when I need to wake up in the afternoon I drink this instead of coffee and it works for me Love, love, love!!! I use this for my protein shakes to keep the fat and calories low. Perfect for weight loss help and an all day energy boost. Doesn\\'t give you the cracked out energy boost that you get from energy drinks but rather a constant source of energy throughout the day. I find that on days that I drink this I have more energy and am more focused and I get a lot more accomplished. A pleasant  blend.  No bitterness, but a little light on flavor.  Would try this or a different blend again, as it is worth the price Nice heat and great flavor.  I get more of an East Indian vibe from it. I use it as a topper or cooking sauce. Love this to make my homemade sauce. I mean, It\\'s yeast? not as good as what you get directly from the tree, prepare and cook yourself, but a good close second lol just be sure to drain off the salty brine and not to include added salt in your dish because this stuff has enough salt in it to cover you! Tastes great. Great popcorn oil! So so good. This is so great for gluten free cooking! Very tasty. You can\\'t tell its veggies Great Nice flavor! My staff really like them This is to die for.  Rich, thick, creamy, even at room temperature. The cereal is great. The problem is that each time I order it, the boxes come damaged. I do not think I will order it again because of this. I could live on peanut butter so I was thrilled to hear that Jif had released Peanut Butter Granola bars because no one knows peanut butter better than Jif.  I\\'ve never been a big fan of granola bars but Jif has changed all that with these protein packed bars that have a rich peanut butter flavor and they gave both my hubby and myself that energy lift we needed while relaxing on the beach during vacation.  These bars are so delicious it\\'s easy to forget that you\\'re eating something that\\'s good for you, in fact hubby is currently in the dog house for eating all of them.<br /><br /> “I’m a member of the Crowdtap Jif™ program, and Jif™ sent me a sample of its Jif™ Bars to try and asked me to review.&#34; I was pleased with the product. Tasty coffee at a great price! Received as promised This awesome! I added fresh corn to it and it was sooooo good! Negative reviews I do not  understand! You can be flexible with this soup! Thrilled with our purchase. I love this product.  We use it  in place of white sugar.  In fact I don\\'t believe we even have sugar in the house!  It is terrific in coffee, ice-cream, pancakes, etc. Great espresso for an ESE pod! These are a great product, I love how large these are in comparison to the wimpy beans available at an unreasonable cost at my local market. I love these, the slight salty touch along with the chocolate is what makes them special.  However, to fully enjoy them I freeze them solid before eating which makes them much more crunchy.  But then I freeze m&m peanuts also!!! Smaller than expected Love these to carry with me in my plane. Yummy!  Very expensive price is the only thing keeping product from 5 stars. For those of you that DON\\'T have a weak stomach......this is a really fun game. I bought this for my son on his birthday and we had a blast.  Even if u dont participate its fun to watch. I liked everything about it... except it needs a kick stand for when you need to leave it standing for a few minutes. always a smooth refreashing drink These bars are delicious, sufficient in protein, low in sugar, and made with quality ingredients (for a processed, protein bar). I also buy these at my local supermarket when they\\'re on sale. I recommend. Love it! These were really good. I\\'m glad I found them instead of paying more money at the store. Perfect I am using this for many new-to-me cocktails and am getting great reviews from my friends. The description says &#34;NesQuik Chocolate Drink Mix Powder, 10.90 oz - 2 Pack<br />Sold by: ACME Purveyors<br />$8.99&#34;<br /><br />I only received one (1) Excellent quality and my whole family enjoyed the selection included in this package. Yummy blue candy for a blue sweets table. I make coffee every day and I don\\'t want to go broke.  They don\\'t go bad and I like not running out.  I\\'ve never had a problem with them ripping either. Really good quality juice. . Great taste and cleansing results.  I ate veggies and fruit if I was hungry and I felt very clean. I was very tired on the second day.  After the cleanse I went to dinner and had some wings and mac n cheese, and I actually got sick.  My body was rejecting the \\'poison\\'. I\\'m getting another because I need to detox again..I can\\'t help it, I\\'m a sucker for Mac n cheese! Nasty to me. :-( best coffee on earth, this is what is served at Lawry\\'s Restaurant I absolutely RAVE about this particular flavor of hint water because it\\'s just SO GOOD. Blackberry is by far my favorite and I honestly wish that all water tasted like this. It\\'s so crisp and refreshing and emulates the taste of tea or a fruit flavored drink with NONE of the added sugar or calories. A good find for someone (like myself) who\\'s trying to get into more healthy habits :) Great oat cereal. Not salty as other competitors. It is addictive, so good. I prefer this way more than the original snickers, and price is good as well. For the price, you can\\'t go wrong.  It\\'s perfectly okay de-caf coffee, especially if you want to pour it over ice and enjoy it cold.  I will buy it again for sure because mostly I\\'m just wanting my &#34;security blanket&#34; coffee for the road.  If you\\'re looking to linger and savor the flavor... maybe not?  There\\'s not a lot of complexity or depth here.  Definitely a bargain for what it is, but you do get what you pay for. Perfect for adding all the spice I need! This coffee taste like Nescafe instant coffee, which I always liked. My local grocery stores discontinues carrying this product, so I have to order it on-ine. It also comes in convenient stick packs for traveling. The ratio of 2 regular to one decaf is perfect for me. You can\\'t beat Oreo. This is the only coffee we drink at home, and has been since we met the owners of the company at our local Costco. They were there sampling their own product. That\\'s not something you see every day. Not only were they very nice people, their coffee was the best. When our kids got their Keurigs for college, they were worried about having to change coffee. I found the K-cups on Amazon and they were thrilled. the stuff is awful. I sent it back Campbell\\'s Sun-Ripened Tomato Soup is a neal in a carton.  Although intended for home use and for heating in a microwave oven, it also can make an attractive meal on camping trips when consumed at room temperature.  The directions state that there is no need to add water, but the soup is so thick, that the aesthetic properties of the meal are not compromised by adding a 50% volume of water.  In fact, you really do need to add about a quarter cup of water in order to transfer the last remaining 5 percent of the product out of the container.  More tastey than expected. Great Match a Powder....I have it during the day as a healthy drink....Tastes great and vwry healthy for you. Amazing tea. All my friends are now hooked on this tea.  I highly recommend it. It  works  u out lol.😁 I always loved these as a small child. The best treats ever. Love this tea! I have tried others but they smell like fish food. I too am a chef as well as my sister. At our restaurant we keep a busy pace. The tea adds to a seltzer with lemon to hydrate and energize. We both love the product!! Good choice for camping trip.  Almost but not quite vegan (our vegan friend eats honey, so she was able to eat and enjoy these, but a strict vegan will not.) Bad investment! They were horrible and shipping was slow and expensive. This candied bacon jerky is delicious.  It\\'s savory and sweet and nice and crunchy.  I ordered it again.'"

Both watches and strap is in a great quality, and the prize is low. Especially compared to the price here in Denmark. love watching all the episodes of Dexter, when i first heard about this series i wasnt too sure about watching it. it took me a very long time to start and now wish i had watched it when it first came out.<br /><br />The fact that he kills and more or less gets away with it, in some episodes you sat on edge of your seat thinking OMG he gonna get caught and then he doesn\\'t, he does try stopping but you know yourself he can\\'t. my favorite episode where the Ice Truck killer, that the ending of that was great how he learns he had a brother, but for his brother to be a baddie and that he had to kill him, i think if he hadn\\'t would it have been different. Oh and The Bay Harbour Butcher, in this it made you think oh no he gonna get caught but he didn\\'t<br /><br />In all ive enjoyed watching them and a shame he had to end. Excellent game!!! This cute, quick read is very different to say the least. There was a comfort to it however. Not just in the creatures, but in the story. I felt like I was in a new aged Alice in Wonderland. It was a bit jumpy. I still found it easy to follow, but I had hoped for a bit more. But for a short story, that is the usual only complaint right? At least as far as the ones that I have read goes.<br /><br />\\\\\\\\\"The aroma you are enquiring upon is me, and you get used to it after a while,\\\\\\\\\" he said, wiping a stale chicken under his armpit. \\\\\\\\\" Now that little snippet made me giggle. Moving on...<br /><br />What more can I say? Inventive, tables that are giant turtles, I mean, imagination spilled all over this short story. (Hence my craving for it to be longer.)<br />I say take a chance, and remember... Don\\'t put your feet in the lava! (You\\'ll understand that bit when you read the book.) When you read, you will find \\'a place of knowing.\\'<br />Bravo! im very disappointed in amazon, theyre startin 2 sell used albums in the new section, i ordered this new and it came with scratches and a crack, track 19 couldnt even play all the way, smh, amazon has got 2 do better Solstice is a head-spinning thriller. It seriously needs to be read when you\\'re alone with nothing around you to interrupt you because it simply is a heck of a ride.<br />I enjoyed this novel, unable to put it down. The twists, the turns had me turning the pages to the end. It is short but it doesn\\'t disappoint. It\\'s mayhem and gore written superbly and certainly not for those who do not appreciate the dark and intenseful tales. Loved it!! My son read it and he said it was very good and interesting. givinig an insight in to the start of Arnies career. Nice steelbook case very good soundtrack and most important a very good movie a very nice item for a steelbook collector. Euphoria is one of the reason why I bought this album, since the victory @ Eurovision Song Contest 2012. I\\'m Indonesian, but I watched the show, and love her performance.<br />My Fave Tracks :<br />- In My Head<br />- My Heart Is Refusing Me<br />- Euphoria<br />- Sober<br />- Crying Out Your Name<br />- Breaking The Robot<br />Loreen\\'s music is influenced by enigma, there are so many \\\\\\\\\"mysteries\\\\\\\\\" in every single track. Electro Pop, Euro,  Harmony Vocals, in \\\\\\\\\"Dark\\\\\\\\\" Nuance Reminds me the style of MDNA\\'s in Frozen.<br />Trust me, buy this album, and u\\'ll get the real european taste of her. Good game I spose It\\'s a good app but not played enough to really rate! Enjoying it so far so we shall see!!!! I good reading great product Love the film and so do the kids I love this film it was a amazing film and it is one off my favourers ever just amazing it Not as good as the real YouTube. It works but only just. I\\'ve been a fan since I was a kid. I haven\\'t bought a new Billy Idol release since Charmed Life and to be honest I\\'d almost given up on him. I\\'m really pleased to say this is a great album. On first listen it\\'s familiar but very fresh. Billy sounds as if he\\'s really enjoying his work again. He\\'s a great performer, he really delivers when he plays live and he clearly loves what he does.<br />If you are a long time fan or if you only know the hits then give this album a listen. Easily up there with his best work. Bought for a present . All the family watched it Boxing Day and we enjoyed it so much great Xmas film . Very nice sound, but the headphones press on my ears a bit too hard, and after a longer time (2-3h) of wearing them, my ears start to hurt. I have pretty normal sized ears :P Other than that, perfect!!! I liked it so much I bought it twice just so that I could share it with a friend. Excellant Average book but ok for a light read. Story line was reasonable although not so much to excite one .Fine otherwise didn\\'t turn up on time and paid extra for day of release. DVD fine just the timing was awful which ruined the experience. Bought this single as it was number 1 the day my daughter was born. Didn\\'t like it at 1st but it\\'s grown on me and now I love it. Great catchy tune. bought for son for christmas he loves  liitle mix just started listening to music after turning 12 yrs of age great for teenages bought for hubby for christmas great fan of ellie goulding love all of her music fast delivery in time to put under tree great fan love her music excellent gift bought for my mum for christmas she a great fan of downtown abbey she has all the downtown abbey sereirs By every year my son his a lego fan loves all kinds of lego James Spader is my fave actor.

Great quality calender. The movies contained in this set are great, however due to the poor way in which the discs are stored in the set you may only be able to watch them once or twice before the discs are scratched to pieces. If you\\'re a fan and like to keep things in good condition then I\\'d advise buying separately. Sometimes cheesey, sometimes dark but always entertaining. By now most people will have seen these films, but for this price it\\'s worth giving them the Blu Ray treatment. A great collection for fans and newcomers alike. Great artwork and really good value for money. If you\\'ve only seen the films then it\\'s worth reading these as there\\'s far more to discover. Brill Arrived well within the time frame, packaged well, exactly as the seller described. Would recommend to friends  and family ! My daughter loves it (so do I) and will watch it over and over and still giggle! Fantastic read. Stayed up til 6am cause I had to finish it! Watched the movie afterwards and it does the book no justice. I bought for my daughter.she is 2 years old,so I read it and I think I should study more Brilliant game Mendelssohn 5 symphonies & 7 overtures.<br />This is a wonderful selection of the symphonic works of Mendelssohn. The second symphony is very impressive and full marks to the<br />choir and soloists. Claudio Abado and the orchestra cannot be faulted in the performances and for anyone wishing to be introduced<br />to the works of Mendelssohn I would unreservedly recommend this 4 CD set. I can but go along with the other positive reviews of this wonderful collection. I am one of those unsophisticates who consider that Tchaikovsky was the greatest thing to hit classical music ever and the performances by this orchestra will surely take some beating. Fab game Deff recommend Bad election, because in the photo, you can see &#34;collectorsedition&#34; , two cds with extra-tracks,and its false, because the product is the original CD with no extra-tracks. Please change the photo because is false. works fantastic and had so much fun with this great detector picks up everything what a great piece of kit I have the \\'talking book\\'  version or something like it!  wish now I\\'d settled for the printed word.  but it certainly<br />puts the message across how accidental so much of history actually is!  not only defeat our enemy with superior<br />weaponry,  but weapons so secret our fore fathers probably had no idea they had,  or did they? I thought it was a book written by a woman for women,  maybe it was?  But it was one hell of a read and<br />I\\'ll say it\\'s just.... weird,  and wonderful,  or just plain great! Always a Peter Green fan actually.  But I like the later songs well enough,  and now can hear many of them on my Kindle Fire. Couldn\\'t put it down.  It dealt with a difficult scenario in a very sensitive way anbd provided much food for thought. Difficult to read but worth it.  The explanations at the back of the book gave much insight into the complications of the Spanish Civil War.  The book gives a snapshot covering a short period of the war. I heard the book described as a lost classic by a well respected author.  I enjoyed reading it for its quality of writing and careful descriptions of very personal moments.  The story was set in an American University during the twentieth century.  Events moved slowly with little excitement but it was compelling reading. It made me laugh until I cried. An amazing read A great read, but heartbreaking story When I got the album I was expecting the Banjo, Double Bass and all around expressive folk I\\'ve come to love about Mumford. While &#34;Babel&#34; is one side of a coin &#34;Wilder Mind&#34; is the of. And both fit perfectly with the band my daughter loves this movie Good music, but I waited a long for the recieved. I would have given the game 4 stars but my daughter accidentally uninstalled it last night, told me straight away, so I reinstalled it moments later and I now have to start again! Why? That is really annoying and unfair. Why do you have to start again from scratch? Not happy &eth;ÂŸÂ˜&cent; This book is awesome I love it. At the moment I\\'m reading ratburgers. It\\'s funny scary sad and happy it\\'s worth reading. I love the little animals It also kept their parents quiet!  How do I find 14 more words when I have already said it all? Just gossip, no real news.  I would have liked to see some actual UK news.  The only options appear to be celebrity, lifestyle or world news. Does nothing worthy of note happen in the UK? As good as the 100 year old man.  Not as funny, but equally entertaining non the less.<br />Looking for the next one. Enthralling, could not put it down.  Abut loose of some connections. Sometimes a bit intangible and unbelievable but brilliant non the less . absolute must for everybody lighting fast charge A Very addictive game that has you playing for hours. Use it at work when it\\'s quiet. Graphics fantastic especially as its free! Very strange film, more like a documentary of a nutcase in prison than a film. Sold it instantly after watching Such a great film. Watched it so many times when I was young and still love it today. Great graphics for the time it was filmed in too After I brought my Kindle HD, I downloaded several games in the hope of enjoying them but every game fell short of making me enjoy them play. Until i came across this awesome, addictive and amazing game. Once you start to play it, get familiar with the gamplay, there is simply nothing that will stop you. Honestly i have been playing this game for past three hours. The only reason why I am writing this review is because it is worth it.  A MUST HAVE!!!! Do not buy....waited ages for it the when arrived was broken straight in bin with a vengeance. Great addition to the fold. I know it will happen, but I don\\'t want to ever see Rebus retire. Intelligent, witty, brutal, dark, and light. And that\\'s just Rebus. This complements what I think is the best series of detective/police/crime fiction books out there. my mother prefers tis version far more than robert mitcham. she was very happy with this purchse. all good.mum happy Very entertaining 100% unmissable Have played this game for awhile.got to level 60 then game froze, restarted after spending a bit of money not a lot! Have reloaded and get to different levels and when I leave and come back sets me back bit fustrating I don\\'t mind spending money on a few keys reluctant to do it now .loved the dog as she had fleas :-) Revolutionary Great Cd with all the favourites saw in the pictures so got it to go with my collection of 007 films a must for any james bond fan what a riot a laugh from beginning to end so get it watch it & have a good laugth as TED is one of a kind. Interesting and e njoyable Excellent game give it a go I have tried quite a few jigsaw and this one is far superior. The size of the puzzle is good. You can choose the number of pieces from quick and easy  35 to 280 for a longer day. If you want a jigsaw app you will like this one Fantastic As close to the real thing as it gets. Love the game Not very immersive Its great bargains galore at your finger tips Excellent.  Couldn\\'t put the book down.  Looking forward to seeing the play. Love it Love this cd Love this cd Fantastic buy Awsome film, can\\'t stop watching it :) What an amazing story, couldn\\'t put it down , so gutted its come to the end , well worth 30p Excellent...... Excellent...... I was so excited to download this app as I am an avid blogger and it\\'s not easy to do on ones phone so I thought this would be great when I can\\'t be bothered to get the laptop out. However, I find it\\'s very slow, lags a lot and crashes very often, it lacks a lot of the features that the website has and just generally needs a bit of work doing to it!<br />It is easy to read other blogs you follow though, so if that is more what you are looking for then this would be fine for you. Both my children (a girl, aged 9 and a boy, aged 5) really enjoy this game. It has easy to follow instructions, colourful graphics and fun sounds! Excellent he has an amazing talent, and vocal range, i enjoyed the CD more than i thought i would, Brilliant I have been tangoing around my Kitchen since receiving this magnificent piece of  Work the whole CD makes me smile Brilliant just what i was hoping it would be, i have enjoyed dancing around the kitchen and singing along. great brilliant Thought provoking How could these women treat there maids like this. Amazing brilliant play it all the time Love it I enjoyed the classic predator .predator 2 was crap .predators luvd  it )) Alien 1 2 & 3 was excellent .4 was a bit far,fetched.brillant box set ))))))) great, but really old, ex-library edition, so not suitable as a gift My wife and I watched this series with great joy and sometimes amusement I was great to watch a program without profanities and other un-needed scenes. That are apparent in lots of programs. Now avidly watching Cranford and later Downton Abbey. Well written series and so realistic Could not put it down i have read all three egyption books and they are great i would recomend them to anybody Best series after Downton Abbey. The settings are wonderful and the actors is portraying their parts excellently. Will recoment to many people Because Kaufmann sings in it. Would like to have all of his recordigs one day! Will wait till my ship sails in. Great easy to use fast learning game. Can use real money to buy extras but little need to compared to other games. Super duper! Neato, gang! This speakers are very good quality considering the price and small enough to transport easily. Although this wasn\\'t a problem for me be aware that the wire connecting the two speakers is short. It just about fits around my TV. Amazing Film , keeps you thinking xx great season and worked fine First class very very good loved the film, love the music bought for my daughter, she was very pleased with the dvd and the delivery time Good but takes to long to finish one country Bought as a Christmas gift, know they\\'ll like it as we saw it when it was in the cinema. Typical Chipmunks film, family friendly fun! It was quite hard get this book from awesomebooks, so I\\'m so happy now, after get it. I really love the story Amazing Bought this for my dad, epic film we both really enjoyed it, hard to imagine it\\'s a true story. Tom hanks as always plays his part very well American pie, I\\'m 47 years old and it still makes me laugh out loud and cringe all in the same moment, there are some parts of the fim we can all relate to this film is defiantly a classic all my children have heard about it now there journey begins. It\\'s one for the collection enjoy people. Love this film sometimes would be good just to have a go at that. Yea This is one of the best films i have seen for a long time and I would recommend it to anyone Some of the disks not working after a year even without frequent use or scratches Quility film so thought I\\'d keep it up to date tec wise i.e blu ray. Always good to see this once in a while An excellent game with so much variety and plenty to do and think about when playing the game. I really liked the product as it arrived in a reasonable amount of time. The price wasn\\'t that expensive for what you get. This book is really good.. One of the most influential books I have ever read.<br />Brilliant.. Definitely worth the money Very good for children and adults alike.<br />It  is  Very  funny.<br /><br />and entertainment<br /><br />I think  it is a great book A great film with a fantastic cast.  I first saw this film when it was broadcast on ITV.  The only write up in the TV Times, (That.\\'s how long ago it was) was the title CANDY.  .If you like the idea of an adult comedy combined with some of the top stars of that era, you\\'ll love this film. Great game I\\'m addicted and I am 62 years old on level 206  thanks guys brilliant fun!!  By the way I had to get my eldest daughter get passed level 92  &quot;who\\'s the mummy&quot;!!!!!!!!!! Love it what\\'s candy crush? I can\\'t get out to get a newspaper, so this is ideal for me. I can\\'t stop doing this game, I love it.Best game ever I already had this on l.p.,now I\\'ve got it on CD excellent.I 4got the words 2 some of the songs,but as the words are inside the CD case, I can sing along with Billy to my hearts content.xxxx Brought this for my husband\\'s birthday,we both think this is a brilliant CD. Luv,it,Luv it, Luv it. All the memories keep flooding back, with these songs, it really took me back to when I was a Scatty teenager.I still am Scotty & whenever I hear David Bowie, it really takes me back in time. What a fantastic collection,I was singing away in a world of my own,going down memory lane,( which I can\\'t mention here!!).Fantastic  music as ever off of Stevie. Well Summertime music, a really feel good CD, absolutely brilliant. best soundtrack I\\'ve ever had the privilege of owning. it does the musical justice. thanks very very much Worth the wait :-) Excellent, full of action. Hope they make more. what a clever thing<br />great game and hours of fun<br />my daughter runs home from school to play this game A fantastic game with hour\\'s and hours of fun. Started playing 3 months ago and I can honestly say I am hooked great graphics well thought through.Thank you . Great album. Just a word of warning to buyers; half the CDs I buy of amazon have broken cases and sometimes this leads to scratching of the CD. The case was an absolute wreck and the CD holding mechanism was destroyed, plastic shards went all over the floor when I opened the case and the CD was scratched from the sharp bits inside the case. I am surprised the CD actually worked. I don\\'t know if I\\'m just unlucky but don\\'t buy a CD if you are not prepared to order a replacement if the first one is broken very nice love it good Great free pool game, I wouldn\\'t pay for any other pool game as this is the best out there. Easy 5 stars. absolutely great. nothing more needs to be said! if you have not read iain m banks....read this. it will blow your mind This story is of normal life, if you are honest with yourself if will give you courage to Change your life.<br />From what ever background we have been brought up in, this read with you own honestly can help one feel the courage to change, not feel one has to do so but believing one wants to do so.<br />With change our lives can be a happy and nicer place to live in. love all of the star wars films needed these to have them all great price delivered exactly when expected you cant go wrong Ive had my pair of PX21\\'s for about 3 years. now and ive had no problems. no quality loss, no breakages, no issues at all.

Good read loved it ,recommend to two friends who both said brilliant Promote delivery.present for someone lived up to the title,very good reading,tied up all the loose ends of the storyline nicely,nice happy ending and enjoyed it Nvgyjnvc uyc b hugvbnmkugv hyfcv This is a great cd for all Fun fans,I bought this for myself.I have played this 100 times are more,its greatttttttt Great great great movie, a great movie for all the family. We all enjoyed this film and had to buy it. The kids just love this movie and could watch it over  and over again and still not get fed up. It\\'s FROZEN!!!!!!! I like it because it\\'s a really good quality game and its free. It\\'s a really good game for people who love horses. let not as good as rest of cds could be better not as good as i expected nice cd I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend who is a big back to the futur fan and he was VERY happy!<br />On the contrary of what other people might have say, it is very easy to build! it didn\\'t even took him an hour! So I believe it\\'s a big expensive for the time it takes, otherwise, really, it looks great and i got it very fast! I purchased this item to use my old Xbox 360 controllers on ps3. The problem is the home function on the unit. Every time I play on my ps3 it keeps going to home page. So sorry 2 stars As expected. Prompt delivery. Very good as usual A great game, really fun and easy! Love the Christmas theme and I like the Facebook connections :) However, it didn\\'t get 5* from.me because of the excessive amount of writing! This is a good app, really easy to use and fuss-free! A really good representation of all the much loved F I\\'m Finding Nemo characters. I rated this app 4* because of all the reasons listed before! However, I didn\\'t rate it 5* because of the amount of things that cost you real money!! A year after the release of the Star Wars movies on Blu-Ray, it was inevitable that the other big creation from Lucasfilm productions would follow sometime soon, and in my opinion it was worth the wait. When it came to producing action blockbusters like these, no-one did them better than the team of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />Raiders Of The Lost Ark gets the series off to the perfect start with Harrison Fords\\' intrepid archaeologist alter-ego Indiana Jones engaged in a race against time to beat the Nazis in tracing the whereabouts of the Ark of the Covenant, and in doing so it\\'s one exciting set piece after another with slam-bang action and more than just a little horror along the way (witness the graphic demise of the films main trio of villains once the Ark is opened at the climax). Then we come to the second film, Temple Of Doom, which may be darker in tone to the first but for me is probably the weakest of the four films - case in point being the mine cart chase sequence, which tends to strain credibility at being a few minutes too long, and the idea of setting the events of the film one year before those of the first is quite frankly a mistake, bearing in mind that this is meant to be a sequel.<br /><br />Five years later along came film three, The Last Crusade, which brings back not only the Nazis as the protagonists in the quest for the Holy Grail but also rather cleverly Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies from Raiders. Best of all is the casting of Sean Connery as Indys\\' dad - although Harrison Ford is the star he is upstaged by the antics of the veteran. This third instalment may at times feel like an updated but slightly watered-down version of the first, but the action scenes and locations are as good as ever.<br /><br />And so to the final film, Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull, and from the start it\\'s clear that the producers left it too long when it came it to making it as Jones is looking more ragged and not as agile as in the earlierfilms. It\\'s a mostly hit-and-miss affair but despite this it boasts an excellent guest cast in John Hurt, Cate Blanchett, Ray Winstone, Jim Broadbent and Shia LaBouef.<br /><br />Apart from the films there is a fifth disc which contains a whole host of superb special features, including the making of all four films plus a few behind-the-scenes featurettes that are well worth catching. To sum up this is an excellent boxset, and no matter whether you like all four films or maybe only one or two it\\'s definitely worth adding to your collection. Swatch have a reputation of producing colourful and funky-looking watches, and this is certainly one of them.<br /><br />Big, bright, bold and an easy to read display make this good to look at on any wrist. Several reviewers have commented that the strap breaks easily after only a few months of wear - not the case with mine, as it\\'s still in one piece after just over two years of use. And the battery life is outstanding.<br /><br />At the end of the day it\\'s a watch. And it tells the time. This is amazing stuff.  While initially it took a while to fully enjoy and appreciate this, we\\'ve had it in the car for the better part of a year, playing over and over, constantly, and my girls love it.  Thankfully we have had no reason to listen to the Frozen soundtrack for months! And with each listen different songs over the year have grown.  First standouts are Mary\\'s Place and the title track, but the soulfulness of Nothing Man and You\\'re Missing, with the uplifting gospel within City of Ruins, Into the Fire, and play-it-loud rock of Further on up the Road, and Countin on a Miracle, and pop of Lonesome Day make this album Classic Springsteen, and it will definitely remain in the car along with another Springsteen album \\'Magic\\' for years to come. Clocking in at over 74 mins you get your money\\'s worth, but the kids singing the la la la la chorus of The Rising at full voice from the back seat will be a priceless memory.  Much better than Let it Go.  This is a must have. Ok, so the genius of Garth Brooks is not in question here.  I asked my wife to get me this (the Â£19.99 version) as a birthday gift - two packed cd\\'s plus a bonus DVD. There was another version available on Amazon for just over half the price but which clearly identified the disc as being Region 1, but nowhere in the product description did it list this as being Region 1 also - I mean, why would there be 2 versions of the same thing listed separately at different prices?  Had I known I would have asked for \\'...The Hits\\' for circa Â£8 as I used to listen to it many years ago in tape and loved it then.<br />This double compilation is great however.  Many of the songs I already knew, but Good Ride Cowboy is a cracker and it\\'s been a joy discovering new music from someone who hasn\\'t been doing much recording these past few years.  Apart from the DVD being unplayable which was a disappointment I would have rated this the full 5 Stars. I\\'m hooked on it its a great challenging game and I couldn\\'t believe it was free I was shocked it\\'s great for when your bored It was fantastic until today out wouldn\\'t open at all very disappointed that the app wouldn\\'t respond to my touch, I kept sending reports etc. And nothing has been done This book made my preparation much easier & I knew what I was expecting in the test, very helpful  & I\\'ll recommend to anyone who didn\\'t go for the lessons before the test Great book, I couldn\\'t put it down Bought for my hubby & he loves this album, it arrived earlier than expected If you love black keys don\\'t hesitate, buy it, arrived on time & it\\'s good music Love this book, it\\'s a good read, I couldn\\'t put it down. way to drag it into the next book .... Good read but now I\\'m gonna die before the next one comes out Out of first 3 seasons, this is the best Good stories and good fun.  Just enough comedy & back story that keep you wanting to see the next episode Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent Great challenges of different levels is really fun to challenge mates if you both have the app and help out mates on facebook and Twitter One of my all time favourite books! So simple to use as every recipe starts with a food processor. Have tried many things and has never let me down. This book is filled with everything that a book as should have, thriller happiness and sadness. Collins is an amazing writer and every time I read this book I always know it. What a great classic album, sing along to disc 1 all day long! Brings back many good memories! Top buy! great movie. you can watch over and over again. Jennifer funny as always. definatelly recomend not only for rainy evenings great film and great item when in the 3d blu ray player Very decent cast who pull off a situation that could very well happen very well. Matt Damon is very good Good action film with a decent story behind it. Probably the next cgi I\\'ve seen in a long time. Decent performance from idris Elba This purchase was for somebody else their feedback to me was that it was excellent pleased with it pleasure to listen to I\\'m a fan so this set could do no wrong Always wanted this - finally bought it 30 years later! Great customer service - would recommend. Great game, nice to have clues that didn\\'t give away the solution too much,  but way too short solved the game in under 2hours, can\\'t wait to play more Gripping game good for all ages If it had a better search and it was easer to find people, other than that the quality is good. Great fun. All those who rate it 4 stars instead of the usual 5 i tell you now Hard Mode is here. Also to new app buyers its the real terraria so don\\'t be worried about refunds lastly for the makers and the developers. Make it so there can be online severs along with LAN. If you cannot, and if you can tell me as a comment on this review i will be happy to accept .Lovin the hard mode (Also the thanksgiving Pet and boss #Awesome) Also are you making it so we can mine wood with pick axe because I\\'m used to playing pc and its annoying when i sit there for hours thinking the games broke. Lovin da game. QuickScopeProJk It gets you thinking. The reality of it is harsh but it\\'s written in a touching talkative way. Brilliant. Tissues needed. I am a firm Grisham fan and find his books fascinating and very hard to put down.  This was as usual up with the best. Was incredibly happy with the product. Can\\'t fault it. If you\\'re unsure about buying it, then I advise you to just buy it. this is  fab film i have seen it so boight this as a present so confident they will love it. Recommended by a friend, loved the book, couldnt put it down, now onto the next one, recommended reading to all Not as good as I thought it would be Very good CD love it 5stars is a little of a disappointment. I aid willingly give this book a thousand  stars. It\\'s a beautifully crafted book diving into the depths of thought and life of the most innocently ill humans. They craft of only a true genious. John green well done to you!! so beautiful, their music makes me float away from reality love it! Amazing book that reduced me to tears. I don\\'t read much but now and then I buy books and read them, and this book has got to be one of the best books I\\'ve read, even better that the fault in our stars I would say. Amazingggg Great case and greys quality. It has a lot of sections and compartments which is great for SD/ lens storage and for spare batteries. unusual gorgeous doll got lots of monster high dolls for my 5 year old for christmas and had to buy this one its beautiful and is one of her favourites now beautiful doll again as all the other monster high dolls are worth every penny they are very high quality and well made Another brilliant doll from monster high got this for easter for my little girl as shes been after her for a while and must say im impressed a film for all the family really funny has you from the start we all loved it would deffo recommend this film best film ever made brilliant images and an amazing story line a true classic good album i dont like it im not a fan but bought for my partner and he loves it loves all the songs whats on bought for partner who loves her music and its a bruilliant album had it on non stop normally theres a few crap songs on any album but every song is beautiful and words have lots of meaning amazing one of their best albums yet every song instantly grabs you and i ended up loving every song its good theres 2 songs i know on it which were released but all the others dont grab you straight away bit of a slow album compared to her first but its ok great game very addicting My grandson absolutely loved this bin lorry. He had it for xmas played with it all that day and has continued to play with it a lot since!  He also loved the additional bins I purchased with the bin lorry and the sounds module.  I would recommend it to anyone. It is very sturdy and well worth the money paid for it. All books a great read couldn\\'t put them down fantastic reading great to take on holiday in totally recommend them fantastic gripping read What can I say?<br />Every album is just so good ...<br />Had the pleasure of meeting these guys in 1964 when they were on tour - lovely young men! All their albums are good but this has to rate as one of their very best ...<br />Some great tracks on this. Fun and addictive but it can be a little boring waiting for the jobs to be done and I wish more could be done in the meantime. It\\'s a superb read, Paulo Coelho is a genius . I would recommend this book to anyone. Complete propaganda, makes Iranians look like animals and lacks any thrill. Waste of time and money and I wouldn\\'t recommend this to anyone. Good game to play on a cold day,  especially when you don\\'t have another game and looking for some character to light up your day. I am a HUGE fan of Merlin so this dvd was perfect!! It was most exciting watching how it all started seeing as it has come to an end (NOOOOOOOOOO). I would recommend this to any fan of Merlin!!! magic Much better than original charger. This book truly captures your heart and you feel like you are in the place of the main character.<br />Funny and thrilling, with an unexpected ending! Great game. I love the songs and the way CharlotteÂ´s and JonathanÂ´s voices express the tenderness of the music. I felt sad when I Heard In the arm of the angel because it reminds me of Princess DianaÂ´s funeral although it is a wonderful song. Game ok,waiting for energy spoils it, some locations are well set and look good.  Storyline is pretty good and keeps one involved in the progress of the game won\\'t be displeased thankyou<br />have assortment now of adaptation end of saga\\'s<br />many thanks amazon<br /><br />sincerely your\\'s corrie<br />looking into my dvd\\'s and pleasure I have owning them.. there is a wonderful cast to portray these different characters, all come to a startling time and necessity for change. Very funny. Didn\\'t find it very humourous, actors were good, wouldn\\'t want to watch it again wouldn\\'t recommend it  to a friend Whilst overall I enjoyed the book I did find all the \\'twitter\\' bits in the early chapters of the book a bit tedious.  The characters of the children were great, they were fun and emotive at the same time .  Bridget grew up as the book progressed. I first saw this book in a pub of all places. So only had a quick look at the synopsis. As it looked interesting and my Granddaughter,<br />who had read it thought I would like it, I bought it. I am glad I did because I found it most intriguing.<br />The story which is a little harrowing is told through the eye\\'s and feelings of a 5 year old boy. Once you get use to understanding<br />his limited view of the world, the store unfolds and builds up gradually.<br />This is a good story that could actually happen and was difficult to put down. Thoroughly recommended. i  wuld like  to write about  these books  when  I  get them sun  10  july I really love this game it\\'s great this is a good usable game. tap and skip previews. easy simple fun great time waister. quick and clear. very happy with it. Seriously, I hate the Notebook, and I am horrified by the usual dumb hollywood movies. This one is so different. I laughed through the whole thing. It takes a realistic approach to sex, relationships and friendship. I really enjoyed it. Definitely going on my top 10 movies list. I had wanted to see this film for a while and finally got to due to Amazon Prime. It is brilliant. The actors all played their roles perfectly, the directing was amazing, the sets makeup costumes all stunning. I don\\'t know why it\\'s getting such flack. It is really a brilliant film blending old and new. Definitely loved both stories. I hoped this fame would keep me entertained but got bored fairly soon after starting this one, not much of a challenge. This was a birthday present for a friends husband and he really enjoyed the CD. nice boots , like the picture , nice deal , fast delivery ....<br />i recommend that , for all , Before I begin, I implore you to note that I am a huge fan of both Les Mis & Tom Hooper (or the \\\\\\\\\"King\\'s Speech\\\\\\\\\" at least) however I must admit this film (and I speak from a film maker\\'s stand point) is edited (and at some points directed) oddly and rather dully. This film seems to be the perfect example of an oxymoron, the tile of The Miserables this film has created such a positive response, however this film is not exactly a masterpiece. Don\\'t get me wrong, the film (for the most part) is well acted, sung and directed, however the transitions of the film are all jump cuts and the film is too fast paced. Most films would give the audience an establishing shot, to show off the setting etc, however in this Hooper just dives straight into the action and gives no time to take in what is happening. Also the time span of the story is nowhere near how it should feel, years go by without any build up. Plus again on the editing side, the cgi in this film is god awful even the N64 games had better cgi!!<br /><br />Also the barricade that the action centres around in the student uprising is tiny, they missed a huge opportunity to create a grand barricade that spawns across several of the streets of Paris rather than some alleyway.<br /><br />Though it may read that I hate this movie to be honest I don\\'t, hence the 4 stars, for the most part the acting is great, though I believe that Eddie Redmayne carried the film more than Jackman or Hathaway. Speaking of Hathaway her re\\\\\\\\\"Bring Him Home\\\\\\\\\", which to me sounds like someone pegged his nose shut then decided to perform a prostate exam with a spoon!! Samantha Barks was by far my favourite female character however, even if they did move \\\\\\\\\"On My Own\\\\\\\\\" to the wrong place, this does not allow breathing space between her \\\\\\\\\"he loves Cosette\\\\\\\\\" songs. Speaking of Cosette, I didn\\'t care for Seyfried in the role.<br /><br />Over all definitely one for the DVD collection but maybe not quite Blu-Ray Great series of books. On book four now and hope this won\\'t be the last of the Clifton family saga Gerard Butler is perfect for the role of the Phantom.  Butler and Rossum  brought the romance of their characters to life.<br />Powerful musical scores. This is a banging app you should definitely download it and gives hours of fun download me now!! Please thank you love it If this book is based on true stories than I think that everyone should read it. Why if? - There are lots of scams, false stories, propaganda which one would need to verify oneself to be sure are true. . It`s well written and easy to read. Almost every page tells unbelievable story filled with lots of detail. This book describes a world where entire nation is ruled by people who are without any sympathy for other human being, a world where every public and private area of life is controlled. If this book represents true stories then `1984` by Orwell really happened and still continue to exist. It is scary because it shows that freedom can be lost. It shows people in power so corrupt that they will do anything necessary to rule (even kill) and ruled so brainwashed that they will praise those responsible for their desperation. If you want to know how does look madness on mass scale then read it. I would recommend this book for everyone who is really interested in economy.<br />I choose this rating because it explains the idea of `free market` which is in this case an economy in which government and bureaucrats creating it make as little amount of regulations as possible. In the beginning of the book author says that it is his intention to convey his message to as wide number of people as possible. That is why he decided to use every-day language in its simplest form. I think that he menage to do it. Thanks to the simplicity of the language I could understand his lesson.<br />In this book he gives numerous examples in which he shows government attempt to regulate an economy in the name of ..., to make it better and to improve the wellbeing of some groups of interest. He shows how those acts and policies often have unintended consequences which in many cases have derogatory effects on economy as a whole. He reminds as that as with many things there are two sides of the story, one negative and one positive.<br />If you read it then you will be able to notice deceptions and illusions which are created intentionally or not by bureaucrats and politicians and other economist.<br />It is a small refreshing book. In the end of the book you will be rewarded with a nice list of books to read.<br />Everyone can read it, and that is what makes this book amazing. It was pleasure to read it because.<br />If there is a common sense then this book is full of it. You will be surprised how insightful his observations are, just enough to convey the idea without loosing someone in detail.<br />Someone in reviews wrote that this book is not about economics. That person is wrong. It`s all about economics. It is about the world in which we live and our cooperation with each other in it. It shows how that cooperation can improve our lives or not, and what has positive or negative impact on it. I think that it deserves five stars because I had a lot of pleasure reading it.<br />I wanted to read it for such a long time since I saw it for the first time on shelf in a bookstore. Here I am writing this review around three years later or so. Why I was waiting so long to buy it? I thought about this book many times. Till I saw it again couple days ago and this time I bought it.<br />I was fascinated about the subject of death brought by a killer. I wanted to know what makes some people do it. S.K. creates a few really good stories. Stories full of horror, as dark as a night with no stars.<br />You can say that you would not be able to kill. I could say the same. However, now I do not know. How would I behave if I was the participant in one of those stories? What if something like that happened to me? I hope that I will never find out. What if it happened to you?<br />You think you cannot and never kill. Read this book and maybe you will be surprised.<br />I recommend this book to those aware that there is darkness in us and around us. Something that is even uncomfortable to consider as a reality. So I hope and maybe you too that it will never envelope, swallow, take control - call it whatever you want - that we will express it trough our action or be part of someone`s dark deed. If you want to know about North Korea and its regime then this is definitely a book that will fill you with lots of information. It is a tragic story. It is a good time killer. It is an easy story with an interesting conclusion about what makes as go mad. It is a good time killer. This book  is a bit more than just a funny story. The story is terrible. Whether it is true or not, it is hard to say. However, it is possible that it really happened. This is a great game and definite my would recommend to any one who wants to play the game on a kindle Fire. So funny, at first was skeptical because i hate zombie movies but the cast was amazing and i really enjoyed it! A great buy. This app is good____if you have a good fast device. Also allot of blood good for gruesome kids/adults/elders but very very hard and fun so get this game and have fun. P.S Fish are friends not food ha ha just kidding Not all the movie soundtracks - but a broad spectrum covering the Kings movie years<br />For Elvis fans only I would suggest Superb album from a great artist Excellent album, Great - exactly what I expected Abba to sound like Enjoyed reading this book, could not put it down at times.  Would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story. This book was bought as a birthday gift and I was very pleased with the delivery,and my son in law was very pleased with the book. The best in the series yet. I Can\\'t wait for the next chapter in Eva\\'s and Gideon\\'s eventful life together Wonderful cd which has given both my wife and I much pleasure.  Kisses on the bottom is excellent, and I intend to purchase another copy for a friend Very high standard of jazz performance with a first class backing.  Her own piano playing is superb, and I would recommend it to jazz lovers A moving and poignant story.  I really couldn\\'t put it down.  I knew nothing of the Paris roundup, and the police involvement.  It was a brilliant idea to link it to a research project sixty years later.  So many emotions were aroused, and I just loved the romantic ending.  A wonderful read.  Well done Tatiana! Love this film, missed it at cinema, hope there is a sequel Granddaughter absolutely loved the movie so bought her the cd and we both love the songs and sing along in the car Three year old grandson has just fallen in love with jungle book and loves to watch balou and loves story and songs Went to see at cinema granddaughter absolutely loves so we watch every time she visits us and she still loves very good! excellent series ! great acting ! shows a glimpse of what could happen should technology take over ! who is man , who  is machine ? miss this at your peril ! I had forgotten that there was actually a plotline and whilst schmaltzy it did hang together rather better than I remembered. DVD was bouight for my wife who also enjoyed the film. The film is a perfect mirror of its time and shows the world an America on the brink of change. Dancing is a dream to watch and the moral tale has sufficient truth to carry the plot. Bought for my wife we both loved rewatching this film it is surely a modern classic. A sad but well executed documentary. We should all take time to know our past as it always shapes our future. Olivier at his vocal best with much detail and a deep truth that had not been voiced before The film is fairly true to the book. Heath Ledger is excellent as Harry the man of conscience and the whole cast and location filming add up to a well crafted tale very well delivered A war movie with a different slant on the same cruelty that was and in some present day regimes still is practiced. Brilliant story well acted. The fact that the core of the tale is true just adds to the whole experience Excellent A really good read Great dvd fun to watch, prompt delivery, very satisfied. I love this show. There\\'s a little of drama , a little of fun and lots of action.<br /><br />The actors are very good and there\\'s a good chemistry between them. Either I was in a good mood and desperate to listen to Motorhead,<br />or this is their best album.  I cannot fault a single track.<br />Well written, well played, consistently great! Pretty typical Nightwish album musically, with Floor Jensen doing her usual stella vocal performance.  It doesn\\'t stand out, but it doesn\\'t disappoint. This season was great especially at the end where sam dies and where dean sells his soul. Incredible absolutely incredible the best srason yet fantastic Jonh Grisham always a great read! THE BOOK WAS NOT FOR ME IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY UNCLE WHO LOVES CALL OF THE WILD & WHITE FANG .<br />IF THER BOOK IS HALF AS GOOD AS THE FILM MY UNCLE WILL HAVE A GOOD READ HOURS OF FUN . LOOKING AT ALL THE CLASICS THAT RACED AT LA MANS BACK IN THE DAY , WHEN MEN WERE MEN & USED THEIR SKILLS NOT A COMPUTER TO DRIVE An excellent lens that deliveres amazing sharp and detailed images with really very low distortion and aberration at full resolution at a very affordable price! It\\'s great fun and also gets you thinking it\\'s good fun and addictive there are  many levels and just amazing find it<br />Fubulouse could play this on and on so much fun Bought it for a friend, they said it was a good read, Could not get into it,confusing beginning, gave up couldn\\'t be bothered! Love it!the DVD is in perfect condition and I would definitely recommend buying from this user. I will be using them again in future purchases BRILLIANT!!! Brought back memory\\'s for my father great a good book. when will the next one come out Superb good good BETTER THAN 50 shades. MUCH MORE REALISTIC. amazing. CAN\\'T WAIT FOR PART 2 I already have loaded onto my kindle. I enjoyed this one but the first one was better. I found this one harder to get into.. looking forward to the 3rd book now though.. Best book so far in the crossfire series. Disappointed to be left on a cliffhanger & having to wait for the next instalment from Eva & Gideon. Can\\'t wait! Item arrived very quickly and in tact. Love the album. Metallica can do no wrong in my book. A visually stunning film. Read the book first and the film met my expectations. yes I liked this but I did guess the plot about three quarters through!! my favourite!!! I could not put this book down, , it was enchanting, funny sad and soulful.It is also pretty unlikely that a man with boat shoes could walk over 500 miles but that is only part of the story..In reality it is about the strength in his heart and determination to finish his quest and see this woman who noticed him , in his sad lifetime.Do read it, its beautifully sad.. Ken Follet never fails to keep you turning the pages . Because it is Funny and real, and at the same time; sad. I also felt that I learned a lot, Thank u Totally loved it who needs Christian when you have Gideon Cross cant wait for the next one. In the mean time I intend to try some more of Sylvia day A brilliant read. Very engaging for the reader especially with the slang language used, the reader feels more apart of the story. This is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fab<br />SUCH FUN Fab game not bad Brilliant.  Gripping very well written. Uncomplicated. I have told all my friends to read this wonderful book. Well done Paulo It is best film in years!! Love it ðŸ‘\\x8d Love It!!!! My daughters love the whole range of Lego Friends.  The instructions are easy to follow, the kids put them together themselves, that\\'s part of the fun. CD is Great as you would probably expect from Greenday. The T shirt is so small that it fits my son\\'s action man but that is about all!<br /><br />Having contacted Amazon they advise that it is advertised as small and that is that. Be warned that when thy mean small it is small - a small child!!! I chose 5 stars because this book is highly addictive! Reading this book is what i do every night Before I Go To Sleep! :) Great read, great characters, a perfect filler for a rainy afternoon. Enjoy! As a dedicated \\'Constant Reader\\' I found this short story a total gem and would highly recommend to all. A journey through a lifetime, intriguing, frustrating and at moments reviving! Loved this flawed character and his path through the years. Sure all constant readers will feel the same, enjoy. this cd is brill one ov my faves just dont get bord ov it cant wate for 4!!!wos a big fan on 2 but likeing the older feeling feel ov one g8 Great album from James, fell in love with his music from his debut album, and he\\'s grown so much since then and created a great piece of work with this album, can listen from start to finish without skipping! Would recommend this to anyone! Fantastic everything an avid godfather enthusiast could want and more stunning quality would recommend this to every film buff very grateful Another astounding read by colleen, my only objective is that I felt it dragged on. The story could hv been cut down as I predicted the ending.x Great film wicked concert wish I was there to see it in person interesting new take on live performance blurays Another great album from pink Floyd great packaging fast delivery highly recomend very Happy Yes good fast delivery great quality CD came quickly and was well packaged, it made a great christmas present. We love Whitney in our house :) One of the finest graphic novels out there, Hush is one of the definitive interpretations of the Dark Knight, defiantly up the ere with the likes of The Dark Knight Returns. Just buy this  you won\\'t regret it! I\\'m a fairly bid DC fan and I loved this movie, in short. A few naysayers effectively tried to slander this movie due to Zack Snyder hate, Marvel fandom or worst of all the Reeve fans who blindly hate on a new interpretation of a character. Man of Steel presents a fresh take on a character and provides all the chills and spills of a summer blockbuster but also reboots the \\\\\\\\\"granddaddy\\\\\\\\\" of all superheroes. Most importantly though this films is ground zero for a DC cinematic universe and is the pre-cursor to the 2015 movie Superman vs Batman, so it\\'s worth watching just for context.<br /><br />Overall very enjoyable Henry Cavill is a good superman and a good introduction to a new Superman, comic fan or not. I really enjoy Farm heroes saga ok Really enjoyed reading thus book. The main concept if hope made it evermore enjoyable, the old, light at the end of the tunnel feeling. Wished the ending was slightly different. However as soon as I got to chapter two I couldn\\'t put it down I fell in love with this book from page one..something heartwarming and very real about Lou\\'s character made the story lovable and gripping. I waited until finishing my next read before writing this review; purely because the imprint it left on me, I wanted to know was real. And real it was. The characters the story the plot;  the whole thing left as hole where I\\'d hoped the book would never end and the story true. Give this book a go, you will not regret it!!!! Great book. Bought after watching the TV series. I gave this as a gift and the recipient loved it! Fantastic series with loads of action and humour.  The main stars are great and the villian, Lars Mikkelsen, should be brought back in Series 4 with Moriarty! Not exactly a film for those expecting a story because it is just about sharks trying to kill everybody in a submerged lab.  However it is fun to pass the time and isn\\'t short of action! A great gift for my Dad who loves watching Poirot on TV! I love this film, i\\'ve watched it about 30 times.  The sound track is fantastic.  I\\'ve also purchased that on itunes and listen all the time Very good The whole relationship is just a thrill, it makes me realise how much I love and need my own partner, putting myself in the situations Eva and Gideon get into. A great fun game that can be quite addictive. Quite accurate to the film\\'s which is a great bonus. Definitely recommend this game for all age groups I bought this game as a present for my daughter\\'s boyfriend who I believe have not played it yet - so apologies I cannot not comment on it except for the write up they impelled me to purchase it in the first place. Was a present I love the jurassic park movies and this game lets me do what John Hammond did. I highly recommend it to other jurassic park fans. So much for 150 c lol lol lol lol lo lo lol l lo lo  lol l a lot to learn how the not be published by a single most popular articles on a regular contributor the same way<br />oins downloaded it don\\'t even give em to ya waist of space game cculross xx THE ENDING<br /><br />YOU NEED TO READ THIS YOU CANNOT MISS THE LAST BOOK IN THIS EPIC THRILOGY!!!!!!!<br /><br />ONE OF MY FAVOURITE BOOKS EVER This is a great app &amp; you can decide what level, number of pieces etc. Once you start it\\'s hard to put down. I\\'m now off to do another puzzle. :-) This is a great game and you get a wee bit addictive (or I am anyway) with it. First got it for my iPhone as it is so good. However, if you are a serious gamer it may not be your cup of tea - but well worth trying-give it a go. :-)) I find this app very useful as I also have it on my iPhone ans iPad. This means that I always have my notes handy. Give it a go - I\\'m sure you won\\'t be disappointed.:-) If you enjoy jigsaw then this app is for you. It\\'s like a traditional jigsaw with any pieces to drop on the floor! Give it a go you won\\'t be disappointed. :-) I love spider which you can decide to play easy or hard. Easy to use and its free what more can you ask for. Bought as a gift for my grandson. He was very happy with his gift. The box unfortunately was slightly damaged and looked like it had been opened before so I am waiting for confirmation that all the pieces were delivered. Apart from that was happy with purchase. Excellent Excellent service and quality. Great read and a fantastic story line.  It would make a great movie.<br />D MacPherson Great idea and very topical at the moment with the 70th anniversary of VE day. very adictif<br />really enjoyed it This film is so funny! I saw it on TV and loved it. . I watched it the second I got home the day it arrived! We loved watching coach carter dvd with samuel L jackson.<br />The dvd was of a great quality and good value for money One of the best sophie kinsella books I\\'ve read. It\\'s such a gripping book and I couldn\\'t stop reading from start to finish. Enjoyed this book better than, gone girl..... Felt sorry for Camille, strange family, kept me gripped, and great ending! Didn\\'t guess that coming. I really enjoyed watching this film.  I thought I had already viewed it before, but don\\'t remember the story line. Another old film to add to my collectionj.  It was as enjoyable this time round as it was the first time. bought to add to the rainy day collection Fantastic book couldnt put it down  had lot\\'s of details in it,cant wait for the last book.Hope we dont wait to long. Not very detailed This is a book I come back to every year or so. The humour and satire always lift my spirits, while at the same time it still worrries me a little, as Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchet (despite their humourous twist) seem to recognise  a lot of human strengths, failings and fallitbilities. Having said that I can easily believe that the M25 and cold calling are the work of evil and that the energy that goes with the frustrations everyone experiences from them are it\\'s aims. brilliant!! wonderful piece of music Brilliant. Very gripping never read such a brilliant book in all my life and what\\'s more it is very educational. Fantastic It was wonderful to revisit this informative narration of the film. I have been playing it over and over in my traveling university (my car) I thought I had purchased the DVD, but actually prefer the CDs myself now, playing them as I drive.. The service was very prompt too from the UK. Thank you Amazon, another happy customer In 1999 I was living and working in Egypt for a long stretch. When I lived there were no English bookshops. A few of the expats formed their own English book club. I found this book at that club all on its own. I hadn\\'t read any of the other books in the series but this one got me hooked. I\\'ve bought them all in hardback since then, after returning to the UK in 2002.<br /><br />It didn\\'t harm the enjoyment of the whole series by reading this first, in fact I think it improved it. Stephen King is a master of his class. It\\'s a shame he is always miscategorised as horror. Great film Very quirky and contistantly funny read! I didn\\'t expect to enjoy the book as much as I did, but found it becoming a great feel good novel that is enjoyable to read. I couldn\\'t put this book down. Heart breaking and warming at the same time. Loved it. Thank you, so, so, much This is an amazing game its very addictive and i would recommened it to anyone who is very competitive 10/10 Yay Brilliant Bought this for my fiancÃ© for her birthday, it is her favorite programme. It arrived on time, it arrived unscathed and it was a really decent price! Ordered as a gift for a friend, so can\\'t comment on the DVD itself, but it arrived very quickly and he seemed pleased with it! Great selection of backstreet boys songs.  Bought for child and is well loved.  Has been played numerous times.  Good to see the young ones love them.  Been well worth it! Brilliant 3 good CD\\'s of a brilliant concert.  Some bests ever.  The sound is very good (but then so was the Charlie Miller remastered soundboard, if you knew how to get that), the best now available.<br /><br />The DVD is a must have too.  Film of the Aug 27 1972 concert is mixed with fascinating films of Neal Cassady, Ken and the Pranksters, and the Dead playing at Acid Test 6 at the Fillmore 8 Jan \\'66.  In retrospect Jan 66 and Aug 72 are only 6 1/2 years apart, but what a world-changing 6 years they were, and the Dead were at the very centre of that. This cd is one of my new favourites, there isn\\'t one song on there that I don\\'t like. The only bad thing about it that I could find is that the last track is 2 songs in 1 when it would have been better if it was 2 seperate tracks. I\\'ll keep it short and simple this book was brilliant. Couldn\\'t recommend it more, It was a gripping tale which really allows you to create an emotional bond with the characters I thought it would let You play the game,but no all you do is watch boring YouTube videos<br />DON\\'T DOWNLOAD<br />I REPEAT DON\\'T DOWNLOAD good quality ,it can de washed over and over again without any problem ,I have it for more than a year , exelent choice Really good book easily read children love it loads of pictures one of the best books I\\'ve ever read! 5 star A very good film wish I had seen it sooner but when it first came out it was said it was terrible<br />After watching this film I give it 5stars This is an absolutely brilliant read. It definitely keeps you interested the whole way through. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of castle and his homour or crime!!!!! I love the crossfire books, but I won\\'t more how can you stop there it\\'s not fair, I would definitely recommend it to a friend :) An awesome album! Loved this book... Absolutely loved it. Beautiful story, gives great perspective and touches the beauty and ugliness of the human race.  I love that death is the narrator. Must read. Perfect. Excellent seller. Unbelievable drivel. Packed with every neuroscience cliche and hackneyed movie trope known in the Universe. But hey, Scarlett Johansson sure looks fine..... I don\\'t know if I\\'m really harsh, or not, but this book didn\\'t amaze me as much as it did other people. It was jt interesting, but I felt as if I had to push myself through it and I saw every \\'twist\\' coming before it happened. Nevertheless, I shall carry on. Hopefully the next book will be better. I had watched the movie Atonement some time ago and so was hesitant when I was first assigned this book to read for my Literature class. However, having now finished it, I am able to say wholeheartedly that the movie - although enjoyable - does no justice to the beauty of McEwan\\'s writing.<br />One thing that stood out for me when reading Atonement was McEwan\\'s ability to force his readers to connect with his characters emotionally; whether positively or negatively.<br />I don\\'t want to say anything else in fear of spoiling any plots etc but I shall end my review by saying that although saddening, the books epilogue was one of the most satisfying, beautiful and heart warming, whilst still remaining realistic I have ever read. That was one heck of a twist! Each main character in this book is so morally twisted, but loveable, its unbelievable and... I cant even form words. A christmas present for my grandson and he absolutely loved it I would recommend it to anyone who has a train mad 4 year old love it so good this game is fun,hard,cool and fun for everyone in the world because anyone can play itðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ’– fast delivery very pleased with item bought the dvd to replace a vidieo wonderful film great for kid and adults who live disney Bought for a friend she said it was great Great game very addictive and has your mind thinking about it all day and asking friend and family for help on it you cheaters Brilliant Brilliant Good It\\'s okay! an album i had years ago - i forgot just how good it is. Romance in durango and black diamond bay rate among the best of dylan, and dylan\\'s the best. My son loves her thankyou The Shining was one of the only books I have read where there were points I was afraid to turn the page. While being a decent thriller (resembling a road movie at times) this does not even touch the original for the fear and menace the Shining had. I felt there was more potential to explain the True Knot, a few of the members of the group were about as scary as the easter bunny. There is much better horror out there. To be honest, every single Manics album since Everything Must Go has been a bit of a letdown for me.  There were always four or five songs which I would love but the rest would be at best average and at worst forgettable.  But thank God Futurology live up to expectations.  You have to give The Manics a lot of credit with trying new sounds and styles while still not selling out to their punk/heavy ideals.  With Futurology they have blended electronica with euro beats and made something which is uniquely them but as they have never sounded before.<br />I would say that the roots for this were lain down with the much misunderstood Lifeblood, but whereas there were weak moments on that album they have learned and improved on to great effect on Futurology.<br />I can\\'t praise this album enough and it seems incredible that these songs were written alongside the meloncholoy/nostalgic songs that were on Rewind the Film.<br />I would also like to say that Nicky Wire seems to have found his bass playing niche as his work on this album is imo his most impressive.<br />If there is a good reason the UK should stay in the EU then this is it! Whatever you\\'re looking for it can be found on eBay. The app is easy to navigate and I would recommend to everyone ! Great stuff ! ! Expected better from this veteran of stage. The songs were weak in places & sounded rather dull and boring for such hype only cannonball any good I have seen this film many times. I am a big predator fan. I still watch this a lot and I gotta admit. its definitely the best movie from the 80s, possibly ever. I hope they do more predator movies. I got this journal pretty quickly, and immediately started writing in it. The questions each night are quite interesting and thank goodness for the short spaces or I\\'d write pages.  I can\\'t wait in 5 years time to look back to my development. Oh and did I mention it\\'s the prettiest journal I\\'ve ever owned!? Badass film that should be sitting proud in everyone\\'s DVD collection. Grab a toothpick and enjoy the ride. Although I felt compelled to finish reading, with every turn of the page I balked at another example of self conscious writing. The relationship between Diana and Matthew is far fetched and self indulgent. On the plus side, the plot is wide ranging and supported with a vast array of interesting, albeit undeveloped, characters. Gallowglass resembles Thor, the Congregation resembles the similar outfit in Twilight and the prickly family members such as Verin resemble other Twilight characters. It just didn\\'t feel new. The first novel, A Discovery of Witches, was a better read. Good film. Got a big lizard in it. Enjoyable most of the time but what a stupid ending, is there another one coming??Otherwise what was the point May I ask hurry up book 2 why do great books take ages to be released<br />the characters are great and there is a good possibility that the story can be spread over several books This is a fantastic series. When people first told me about the hunger games I was rather sceptical. Upon reading the hunger games I found that my suspicions were to be confirmed. I HATED THEM. Then one day, a friend of mine who is also a bookworm like myself told me about this series and handed me it to try. My intention was  to take it away, research the plot and then pretend I had read it so as to not hurt his feelings. But then one night I found myself in the unfortunate position of being unable to sleep but without reading material. So I decided that as this book would probably send me right off anyway so I picked it up and began to read. And read. And read. The next time I looked up it was three in the morning!!! This series is absolutely superb. It is written masterfully and imaginatively with a truly brilliant storyline. A must read for any fantasy sci do fan. It resides at a position leagues ahead of anything else in this category - congratulations to James Dashner I loved this! Good quality, read beautifully by Stephen Fry. Good expression without sounding patronising (for adult listeners). Now I wan to but all the others in the series! Arrived on time, in very good condition, as it said on the order, no issues what so ever. happy customer. Am loving this soundtrack My granddaughter was shown selected parts of this film in school as part of a history course.  The film is too long for the school to show the whole thing.<br />I said that, in order to understand fully the evil of Hitler\\'s \\'Third Reich\\' and the courage it required for Oscar Schindler to do what he did, she should watch the whole film, not just edited sections of it. brilliant cd. had it once, but lost it when i sold my car. just had to replace it. better luck with this one Ideal for my tablet- Came very quick both disc in good condition very pleased thanks Love it!! Great game, easy rules but strategic and very competitive! Really good, if you like Coldplay you\\'ll love this. This was a present for my partner so I was lucky to be able to enjoy it too - definitely go buy it. I am absolutely thrilled with the purchase :D it came quickly, the movie was brilliant and for such a reasonable price :D Neat. &#34;EMAZING ED&#34; I Love Your CD! Although larger than expected, works well and functional, another watch in my selection Scorsese\\'s best film since Goodfellas. I have seen it 3 times already. As you can guess it is 3 hours of sex and drugs. Yet people are giving it bad reviews because of this. What were you expecting to see? That is like me giving Jurassic Park one star because there was dinosaurs in it. I think some people go out of their way to have something to moan about. Anyway, this is possibly the funniest film I have ever seen. The acting is amazing ( especially Jonah Hill ). 3 hours felt like 90 mins. Highly recommend. ( Do not watch with your mother ) Love it I bought this DVD because Tom Hiddleston is a phenomenal actor.  I was not disappointed, while I find Shakespeare tedious at best I found my self sobbing at the part where Mr. Hiddleston portrays the young Henry V whose father is dying and he has put on his father\\'s crown trying to imagine what his father must go through being king.  Mr. Hiddleston puts forth great ability and talent in portraying Henry V in this movie, he had an awesome handle on the Shakespeare language and made it entertaining to watch.  Thank you Mr. Hiddleston to remaining true to your craft. No need for a lengthy expalnation, just a few superlatives. Gripping, enlightening, worrying, sad in some ways but alwaysleaves you booking time in your diary for the next episode. we watched 4 episodes a night, on consecutive nights, couldnt wait any longer Brilliantly filmed. Great stunts. All round enjoyable film. Its very good, But I was expecting a little more. The better tracks are when DG gets on the Drums. A skilful game and easy to,play Well worth watching A really nice, friendly book that\\'ll put a smile on your face. The old man is young at heart and a joy to read about.<br /><br />It\\'s not a very thin book tho, so be ready for a good long-ish read. Loved it was quite good excellent brill watchable it was ok Takes a little to get used to, very sensitive and responsive. Instructions are a little confusing! This album could not be any better I love Nicki Minaj she is my best person and singer in the whole world and all of her music is really goodthere were songs I did not even know on the disks but I got to like them all and now I listen to it every other day or every week it is really good and I think you should get it. SKYFALL IS A BRILLIANT CD TO HAVE IN ANYBODY\\'S COLLECTION.<br /><br />IT IS THE RIGHT SONG FOR A BOND MOVIE, FOR 2 REASONS.<br />1. IT DRAWS YOU IN AND MAKES YOU WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE.<br />2. IT IS SUNG BY ADELE WHO HAS A FANTASTIC VOICE. BOUGHT FOR HUSBAND WHO SADLY DIED JUST AFTER CHRISTMAS<br />LISTENED TO IT TWICE<br />LOVED IT<br />WOULD RECOMMEND THE CD TO EVERYONE SAME AGAIN, BOUGHT AS A PRESSIE FOR CHRISTMAS<br />LOVED IT<br />PLAYS IT ALL THE TIME<br />WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE I love the music from \\'once\\' which I performed in my recent school concert and heard good things about the musical, so bought the film. The filming is very shaky and could get into it. A shame :( Great viewing The research seems well done and the &#34;chase&#34; is exciting but Mr Brown expects to much of his readers to beleive that someone\\'s soul\\'s weight could measured at the time of death; also his &#34;rebirth&#34; followed by running and climbing stairs is ridiculous in the extreme. I thought is was very well written well worth reading Twin Peaks was a weird series and I never really understood it, when I watch this DVD I am hoping to  get to grips with the storyline Excellent , played it again and again An interesting Scenario I had read about this Disney Film but found it fark and brooding , not really a children\\'s Film at all. A very good buy . classic album! Great seller. Arrived in the post within five days of ordering! Couldn\\'t be happier. Hey,<br /><br />I also like this series. It\\'s one of the best ever made. There are sensible but really surprising turns in every episode!<br /><br />But I have one question to our British friends. I would be thankful if anyone would answer...<br /><br />I want to know, whether every season has German sound, too. I cant find this in the description.<br /><br />The reason I ask: The price on German Amazon is 100 (84 pounds)!!!<br />So it would be cheaper to buy it from British Amazon...but the episodes in German are necessary for me<br /><br />If anyone who knows it would write a commentary, this would be awesome...Thank you! ;-) Grand daughter loves lego. I love this book. As an African living abroad I could totally relate with the main character. It got me laughing at the same time thinking....Thumbs up!!! Family all enjoyed sitting down together and watching this. Great family movie.Funny and clever and even a bit educational. will be watching it again soon. I bought this for my son for Christmas and as he is into Halo and drawing / sketching cartoon action figures, it was exactly what he wanted. Great All of the books in this series were amazing, and although this was my least favourite of the three it was exquisitely and passionately written like the other two. I cannot recommend this series enough. wow what a book  i was with her ever step of the way<br />even in the tears  i have read it 3 times over There are just several words to describe this book: brilliant, amazing, great, fantastic! Just the must-have book for anyone who consider themselves to be sherlocked or a fan of Conan Doyle. 10-Oct classic kanye, doing his kanye best, wearing his kanye west, i guess you could say he passed the kanye test, cus this album is the bomb. This game is sooooo addictive. An improvement on the original Temple Run game but just as addictive with far more interesting runs :D Great wee game that will get you hooked playing. However it can be very glitchy at times. Especially about updates. Word of warning - don\\'t uninstall the game if a glitch causes it to stop working. Just wait it out. I learnt this the hard way and lost my level 30 game :( back to square 1 for me :P Have to admit I never thought much of Taylor Swift. If anything I used to dislike her with a passion. However, as soon as her two new music videos came out (\\'Shake It Off\\' and \\'Blank Space\\') I have to admit, I was hooked. Not only were the videos excellent but her music was actually enjoyable. When this album came out, I did have an urge to listen to it but decided not to. This was until the middle of January when I heard the 30-second samples on Amazon. Out of the 13 songs, I loved the 9 and decided to finally try it out.<br />After the first listen I loved all 13 songs although as you listen more and more to this album, your favorites will soon emerge. Welcome to New York is perfect as a first track on this album but dissimilar than all the rest of her songs in this album and very different than what you would normally expect Swift to release. My personal favorites are (apart from (2) Blank Space and (7) Shake It Off): (3) Style, (4) Out of the Woods, (10) How You Get the Girl & (12) I Know Places. I hope she makes a short film with these 4 songs (like Lady Gaga\\'s ARTPOP and Lana\\'s Tropico) as I believe they would all fit well together.<br />I bought this digital album while it was on offer (Â£5.50) and I am so glad I did. Now that I have heard all these songs and this album has grown on me I would probably pay more than that but I don\\'t think I would have bought it if it wasn\\'t on offer. This album has completely changed my opinion on Taylor Swift and highly recommend it to everyone but especially to those who hated her first two albums and thought her previous album \\'Red\\' was average (like me). only watched this film once and I can honestly say it is 3 hours of my life I will never get back, waist of time!!! You know how the story is going to pan out from the very beginning but still you have to finish the book. I have always been team Eric and Sookie and if like me, you are too, you may be disappointed. I love all of the Sookie Stackhouse novels and this one was no exception. This was how Charlaine Harris saw fit to end her novels and when you think about it, we all saw this coming. Im sad that the series has ended but at least we have the tv show to keep us going. I was unsure about reading this book.There were many mixed reviews but I decided to read anyway. I only read half of the book before giving up. I had already worked out the plot halfway, I knew most of what was going to happen ( I read the last couple of pages once I gave up reading and yes I guessed correctly) I found the book to be really draggy.It went on and on with not much happening. It should of been shorter any by half way Id had enough.Not a book for me! I bought this for my wife who rates it as excellent. beautiful voices. jonathan has one of best tenor voices This processor for this price is honestly underrated . It is a ridiculously good piece of equipment and for it\\'s price , well in my opinion the seller is being robbed for it\\'s incredible power for this tiny price. a very watchable film full of action and with a good many varied trwists and turns  a n enjoyable experience Despicable Me is one of the greatest movies of the year! It is very funny and great for everyone!<br /><br />I would recommend this DVD to children and adults everywhere! 5 stars! The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a very, very cool movie! It involves all the well-known characters mixed with the usual action. This movie is really great and I would recommend to those who enjoyed the \\'Lord of The Rings\\' movies; 5 stars! Perfect, what else can I say. If you know Modern Family, you know that it is very funny, unique, great at hiding little messages and an all round amazing American comedy - this continues into season 4!<br /><br />A must buy for Modern Family lovers! This film is amazing (as the four academy awards suggest) with great actors and an outstanding story line - based on a true story.<br /><br />This film encompasses a great psychological base line with the effect of a film that really gets into your mind. The story is about a professor who has schizophrenia and his journey to overcome this obstacle while his family and friends cope with the trouble.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to anyone! We are going to watch this movie today and we know that it is a great movie.<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />Jeff A very very addicting game, absolutely love . It, good game to pass the time, highly recommend everyone to get this game, it\\'s freee Total waste of time.<br />Kept waiting for something to actually happen and nothing the whole way threw..rubbish to say the least.<br />I can understand the history of the film but can\\'t believe that this was an apparent success with such severe boredom for the audience. At the end they write a few lines of what happened next, why is that not in the film.<br />I recommend you watch something else unless you are keen to waste near enough 3 hours of time. I saw movie &#34;Kingdom of Heaven when it was shown on television first time. Producer and Director reported all facts as were written in the history of Jerusalem.<br />Salahuddin the Leader of Muslim Army was shown as a very wise, brave, sincere and fair Muslim General.<br />Instead of taking revenge against Christians for their crimes where the crusaders killed thousands of Muslims in previous wars, Salahuddin accepted the proposal of Christian leader to give safe passage from Jerusalem fort to the sea to all Christians if they lay down their arms, even though the Christians had been defeated and could have be killed with ease. Salahuddin did not kill a single man or woman after he accepted the proposal to stop the war and let Christians walk from Jerusalem fort to Meditterian ocean where ships of Christians were anchored down to take all Christians and Crusaders back to European countries. This does shown how war in religion should really be applied. A credit to Salahuddin for applying through correct religious understandings. A Thousands Splendid Suns, is one of the best books I have EVER read, he is a writer with exceptional talent, and his two main characters will never leave you, a truly incisive, thought provoking and harrowing read. If you haven\\'t read it, YOUR MISSING OUT BIG TIME. Narrated from Hazels point of view this book is perfection to the core. Hazel narrative tone never takes on a pitying tone and this makes you love the character even more. Then there\\'s Augustus. The great Augustus waters who you just cant\\'t put in a box. His sarcasm drips off the pages, with much humor. And his character is someone who never leaves you because of his wit, charm. He\\'s perfect in the none conventional way and makes you fall in love with him like you\\'re falling in love for the first time. Augustus and Hazel make you remember why we\\'re alive in the first place.<br /><br />One thing about the fault in our stars is that you will never feel the same. You\\'ll find yourself trying to emulate these characters and using their quotes in everyday life. These characters will never leave you. So along with the witty narration and amazing plot John Greens The fault in our stars is the best young adult book ever written. The characters Augustus and Hazel dance off the pages and make you think about all those big questions about death and the hereafter which make you feel so small. Lovely Kindle, lovely price and the service from Amazon is very supportive to help you get up and running. I hope to have a lot of enjoyable use. Hard going i wont lie you need a lot of stamina but well worth it I hven`t read this book for years.It was lovely to read it on my kindle fire.<br />I would reccomend it to anyone. We know it\\'s a romantic comedy and we know what the ending will be. But the witty rapport between the two mains, as well as the addition of some great characters from Woody Allen and Patricia Clarkson, is what makes this film great. A well written script created the anti-flick, making fun of the traditional film that we are all used to seeing and providing moments of shared laughter between director and the viewers through previously laboured points.<br />Is it going to win awards at Cannes? Of course not. But it will lighten up an evening after a long day at work and is still just as funny the second (and third and fourth ashamedly) times you see it. I couldn\\'t find this DVD cheaper on another site and was pleased to be able to buy the full box set for this amount.<br /><br />This season is yet more of the attractive vampire diaries cast, with a few new additions and, of course, more legends to uncover. This season explores the origin of vampires, while the evolution of the love triangle between the three main characters continues. New relationships are formed elsewhere too, along with the development of characters in the plot.<br />I feel it was at points a step up from season 2 and will be excited to see where this goes into season 4. Gripping and addictive as always. I couldn\\'t find this DVD for a better price anywhere and was pleased as always by the service amazon provided.<br /><br />This season of the vampire diaries explores the character of the elusive Katherine, along with the further development of the love triangle established fully at the end of last season. Nina Dobrev is both beautiful and convincing as she plays two characters completely differently on screen, sometimes against one another. I\\'m sure it\\'s not an easy feat to create the sense of two people, that can be distinguished by the viewer without mention of names. The rest of the Cast, especially Paul Wesley and Candice Accola, also show real skill as their characters develop.<br />With more legends, attractive monsters and romantic interests, this is every bit as addictive as season 1. I didn\\'t feel the script let me down as much as I might expect from a second season and at some points, it even capped season 1. As new. Cheap and daughter liked it. A really great book, very addictive and really interesting!<br />I recommend to all who love a crime thriller with a twist! Great film I love the oatmeal comic and images, and this book is fantastic, I recommend it for all dog lovers highly recommended highly recommended highly recommended Works fine on my kindle. Just have to setup the proxy settings manually. Instructions are given when you open the app. Thank you for this level. Been stuck for days. Just like candy crush guys you don\\'t know when to cut the bulshit. You think we will buy more boosters if you make the level impossible. Well what happens is people  get frustrated and delete the game instead. Great app. Everything synced on all devices. Love it. This story was fascinating. I don\\'t have much prior knowledge into China\\'s more recent history, which sometimes makes personal or family memoirs off putting when they assume you understand more than the basic details of the period. This was not the case with Jung Chang\\'s interesting tale, delicately interwoven with China\\'s troubled past and it\\'s hoped-for futures. I was taken along the journey of change from the last vestiges of the feudal world through wars, communism and the universal desire for peace and family. Three generations are portrayed here, giving you a rare chance to see the development of three young women in a rapidly changing world. I would have given it five stars, however some passages required re-reading for comprehension as the author referred to relatives without always making it clear to whom they were related and sometimes mentioned a person who hadn\\'t been present for many chapters without reminding the reader who they were. Other than that it is a wonderful story and I would whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the individual stories of China in the past century or the web of family in times of extreme peril. Great book. Although i regret a little not having bought it new as this would have meant more revenue for James Bowen and Bob. Thanks to reading other reviews I found out that if you are a half size, that you should get the upper size as they are a bit small. So being a 5\\'5/6 I took the plunge and went for a 6. Fits great and very comfy.  Also good service came sooner than expected A fitting testament to one of the great opera performances of my 40-odd years of opera going, and one I broke the habit of a lifetime by queuing overnight for tickets (not since Sutherland\\'s \\'Lucia\\' in 1972). I was not in London for Callas\\' epoch-making Toscas in 1964, but this performance is a worthy companion. Have owned this film and sound track in every format imaginable since 1964. Good to have it now on DVD. Once I started to read I couldn\\'t put it down.there were few mistakes but nothing I couldn\\'t understand.highly recommend if you have few days to spare. Delivery and Packaging: Delivery speed was exceptionally fast arriving well before estimated delivery date. Packaging was suitable and very good for the type of product.<br /><br />The product itself; As someone who is not a particular fan of the zombie genre itself. I have to say I really enjoyed the narraitve style and writing of this book. The interview/documentary/report style really offers a unique perspective of many different peoples and cultures and thier experiences. It chronicles from patient zero to the aftermath of the breakout of the zombie war. This is a great book whether you are realitvely new to the zombie genre or a veteran reader of zombie novels I would say this book definitely has something to offer/appeal to all readers. Having also listened to the audiobook adaptation as well as having read the book I would say this is great across various media\\'s depending on your preference. In the case of some narrative tales in this book I would say that Audiobook is actually a better way to enjoy this book as it captures the emotions and experiences of the characters a lot better than if one was simply reading the book.<br /><br />Now for those of you who are curious as to how this book compares to the film adaptation. I would say if you enjoyed the film you wouldnt necessarily enjoy the book as the film is World War Z in title only. The zombies in the book are a lot more the traditional concept or public perception of zombies. I.e slow moving and the way it transmits the zombie pathogen is a lot more terrifying as it can go unnoticed easily until you hit the later stages so again it\\'s interesting to read about that in the books. In the film adaptation, the report/documentary style is completely absent and the zombies are more that of 28 days later. I go into some detail about the differences merely to convey that the book is vastly different from the film and in terms of enjoyment of this particular title this information can make all the difference in your decision to buy this book.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book? Definitely I think this book is a great addition to any book collection as the narrative style etc is excellent and I think this book has something to appeal to readers of all types be it your new to the horror genre or already a fan. Eitherway this book is a most certainly a must read. Delivery was prompt and well packaged<br /><br />The product itself looks smart and is nice and compact, The picture quality is really good and the series plays great on both DVD player and using the DVD disc drive on a computer. The menu and features on the discs are easy to navigate.<br /><br />The series itself; Having never watched the original BSG series I can\\'t comment on how it compares to this version. However, I would say that this series is great for anyone who enjoys sci-fi series as it\\'s very well written, directed and acted. The only thing I would say is that the last series does feel rather rushed and the ending of the series for me felt a real let down.<br /><br />I would say for anyone who is looking for something new to watch this is a great series and addictively good too!<br /><br />What\\'s inside the boxset? Boxset includes Mini Series; Seasons 1 - The Final Season as well as Bonus Discs. It\\'s worth noting that this is not technically the complete series as it doesnt include The Plan so anyone wishing for the complete collection will need to buy The Plan seperately as I dont believe it is available to buy as part of the boxset itself.<br /><br />Would I recommend? Definitely, I certainly feel this is a series that everyone can enjoy as it has a bit of everything. I would recommend adding this to any collection. Delivery and Packaging: Delivered next day and parcel was tracked, Packaging; perfect size and packaging for the item being delivered.<br /><br />The Product: The third installment in the Selection Stories covers the final stage of America and the remaining contestants competition to win Prince Maxon\\'s heart and ultimately the crown. The stakes have never been higher as things come to a head with rebels on thier doorstep and an increasingly unstable king. What will become of Maxon and his selection? Full of intrigue much like the previous installments in the series and of course plenty of romance. A perfect final installment of Prince Maxon\\'s Selection. Very much looking forward to the next book in the series \\'The Heir\\'.<br /><br />Would I recommend? Certainly, this series is a must read for any teenager, young adult who enjoys romance with a touch of intrigue and action. Delivery and Packaging: Delivered next day and parcel was tracked, Packaging; perfect size and packaging for the item being delivered.<br /><br />The Product: The second installment in the Selection Stories covers the middle stage of America and the remaining contestants competition to win Prince Maxon\\'s heart and ultimately the crown, the stakes are raised as rebels threaten the peace of the land and the very existence of the Royal Family. Full of intrigue much like the previous installment in the series and of course plenty of romance. A perfect sequel to The Selection. Very much looking forward to reading the rest of the series.<br /><br />Would I recommend? Certainly, this series is a must read for any teenager, young adult who enjoys romance with a touch of intrigue and action. i really enjoyed reading this Arrived on time. Great product Typical  Jack Reacher by Lee Child.<br />Intrigue and action all the way.  Excellent twists to the story.<br />A must read. definatley something different for quo brilliant Absolutely brilliant, but can\\'t seem to get past level 50!!!!!! On loading it crashes everytime on note4 Would not download onto my tablet Awesome game even the kids love it ....... This book was recommended to me and I must say, I was definitely not disappointed. Packed full of drama, murder, mystery and storylines that kept me awake \\'reading\\' when I should have been sleeping, many a night. A really poor read. A highly unusual example of the film being better than the book. Monotonous, one dimensional and stereotypically American. The item is in perfect conditions but I expected a 2 disc dvd set instead of only one. The product is good anyway. Greatest Beatles album ever very good reading Really good game. I never thought that this item would be as good as it was. This is definitely well worth the money. The outer material I thought would have been plastic so I was very surprised when I realized it was like a latex consistency. If anyone is considering buying this product then my advice would be to go for it, You won\\'t be disappointed.... Extremely good quality DVD, horrible movie but needed it to add to my collection. Fast delivery and will definitely order again.... Only negative is that the Troll song is missing ;-( but the fab price makes it worth while!! Worth buying! Daughter loved it!  Excellent service. My son is very happy with this.  Good service. My daughter has not stopped palying this since it arrived!  Excellent, speedy service. Twas a lovely indie film, very well acted and beautifully directed. Not quite what I expected but good all the same After thinking it was just going to be another love story BAM, there\\'s a fab twist with a great ending. Loved every minute reading it, I couldn\\'t put it down! Great product, thank you!! Brilliant best product Quality product Excellent series. Full of action and intrigue the acting is excellent. A must see series Proper next level David Baldacci is simply a great constructor of stories. He keeps your interest in what is one of the best &#34;page turners&#34; of the year. Having not read all the JR novels this gave me a real insight into Reachers character. A great tale told at a good pace. Best season of the walking dead yet!!'"
